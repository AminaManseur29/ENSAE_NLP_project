{"text":"for targeted delivery of colloids to the lymphatic system , the colloids should efficiently reach and remain in the lymphatics for a considerable period of time . as per the current knowledge , diffusion and phagocytosis  are the two mechanisms through which colloids reach the lymphatic system . several parameters including particle size and charge have been shown to affect the direct uptake of colloids by the lymphatic system . Moreover, surface modification of colloids with ligands that interact with lymphatic endothelial cells or macrophages has also been explored as a means of enhancing lymphatic targeting. In addition to these strategies, recent studies have highlighted the potential of using external physical forces, such as ultrasound or magnetic fields, to actively guide colloids towards and into the lymphatic vessels. Despite these advancements, challenges still remain in achieving targeted delivery of colloids to the lymphatic system with high specificity and efficacy. Nonetheless, continued research in this area holds promise for improving the delivery of drugs and imaging agents to lymphatic tissues for improved diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as cancer and lymphedema.","prompt_len":432.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1208}

{"text":"Most species are hermaphrodites\u2014a single animal can produce both eggs and sperm, meaning it can fertilize its own egg, not needing a mate. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time. Others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. When it comes to sequential hermaphrodites, there are two types: protandrous and protogynous. Protandrous hermaphrodites start life as males and later transition to female, while protogynous hermaphrodites are born female and later develop into males. This type of hermaphroditism is common in fish, such as clownfish, wherein when the female dies, the largest male changes sex and becomes the new female.\n\nHermaphrodites are also found in some species of snails and slugs, where they can exchange sperm with other individuals during mating. This trait of hermaphroditism is particularly beneficial for animals living in environments with low population density, where finding a mate can be a challenge. Moreover, hermaphroditism can increase reproductive success as individuals have the option to mate with any other individual of the same species they encounter.\n\nDespite these advantages, hermaphroditism may also pose a disadvantage as it reduces genetic diversity and increases the risk of inbreeding. However, some species have evolved mechanisms to prevent this, such as self-incompatibility, which prevents self-fertilization and promotes outcrossing. \n\nOverall, hermaphroditism is an intriguing phenomenon that continues to capture the attention of researchers and wildlife enthusiasts alike, as it highlights the incredible diversity and adaptability of life on earth.","prompt_len":325.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1704}

{"text":"Free movement of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination. The EU manages imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, \u2018Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States\u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \"trading rules\" that are \"enacted by Member States\" which could hinder trade \"directly or indirectly, actually or potentially\" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \"wide test\", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former \"Buy Irish\" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \"protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants\", \"national treasures\" of \"artistic, historic or archaeological value\" and \"industrial and commercial property.\" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger's German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018fundamental pillars of a democratic society\u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36.","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":3167}

{"text":"About 900 people packed into Toronto's Opera House on Tuesday to pay tribute to the pop star, who died on Sunday. They heard the band Holy Holy, featuring Visconti on bass and former Bowie cohort Woody Woodmansey on drums. \"There is no better way to work through grief (than) through music,\" Visconti told the audience, before playing a selection of Bowie's biggest hits. They also performed the 1970 album The Man Who Sold The World in its entirety. \"This is some of the best music that's ever been written,\" said Visconti - who was Bowie's producer throughout his career, starting with the 1969 album Space Oddity right up to his swansong Blackstar, which was released last week. Before the show, Visconti told fans that Monday, when he had learned of Bowie's death, had been one of the worst days of his life. \"We actually had to talk about whether we were going to perform more on this tour,\" he said. \"[But] music is magic. It's better than any pill to take, It's better than any drug.\" The sold-out crowd signed a book of condolence before the show; while many had painted a lightning bolt across their face, mimicking the cover of Bowie's 1973 album Aladdin Sane. \"This is some celebration,\" said Visconti later. Tuesday night also saw the first performance of Bowie's stage musical Lazarus since his death. Cast members did not acknowledge the star's absence or make any changes to the show - although a video screen in the lobby showed a photo of the musician with the words \"In Memoriam, 1947-2016.\" But many fans who had bought tickets expecting to celebrate Bowie's music found themselves mourning his life instead. \"It was incredible. I wept a lot,\" said Evan Schwartz, a 20-year-old student from Stanford, Connecticut. \"It was beautiful.\" Bowie co-wrote Lazarus with Irish playwright Enda Walsh, the award-winning writer of Once. It was conceived as a sequel to the 1970 movie The Man Who Fell To Earth, in which Bowie had the starring role, and features many of his biggest hits, including Changes, Life on Mars and Heroes, as well as tracks from his recent album. The star's involvement was the main draw for Roberta Bethencourt, who attended Tuesday's performance. \"I used to go to the library and when other kids were getting books, I was getting Space Oddity and bringing it home and playing it over and over again,\" she said. \"I had no idea what an impact he had on so many people. I loved him because he was so different and unique.\" The producer of Lazarus, Robert Fox, told the Telegraph the musical will transfer to London \"in the fullness of time\", giving British fans the chance to see one of Bowie's final works. Bowie's death was announced in a statement on Monday, which said he  \"died peacefully, surrounded by his family\" after an \"18-month battle with cancer\". As yet there has been no official confirmation of the type of cancer Bowie had. But Ivo van Hove, who directs the New York production of Lazarus, told Dutch public radio broadcaster NOS that he had suffered from liver cancer. Tributes have continued to be paid by fellow musicians and contemporaries. Mick Jagger, who recorded a cover of Dancing in the Street with Bowie in 1985, said: \"David was always an inspiration to me and a true original. \"He was wonderfully shameless in his work. We had so many good times together... He was my friend. I will never forget him.'' Film director Cameron Crowe, who worked as a music journalist in the 1970s, recalled the six months he spent with Bowie in an essay for The Hollywood Reporter. \"[He] was the most generous and entertaining interview subject I'd ever met,\" said the film-maker, whose credits include Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous. \"Nothing was off-limits. When he asked to meet you, it was rarely casual. You would be ushered into the room where he was waiting, and the artist would be perfectly positioned, his head cocked at the perfect angle to catch the light. It was not an affectation. He naturally staged himself, only to break out of such an iconic pose with a crackling smile and jaunty warmth.\" Annie Lennox added: \"At the loss of someone who has impacted and influenced your life, you can hardly begin to measure the shape of what's left behind. Our personal and collective inner landscape has shifted and we're trying to come to terms with it.\" No funeral details have yet been announced for the musician, but a memorial concert is planned for New York's Carnegie Hall in March. The Brit Awards will also pay tribute to the \"visionary and ground-breaking\" artist at next month's ceremony. Brits chairman Max Lousada said the \"extraordinary life and work\" of \"one of our greatest icons\" would be honoured at the show, at London's O2 arena, on 24 February.

{"text":"Yet most Venezuelans live in poverty, many of them in shanty towns, some of which sprawl over the hillsides around the capital, Caracas. Venezuela's economic fortunes are tied to world oil prices. A 1970s boom largely benefited the middle classes, but a subsequent price collapse condemned many of them to poverty while eroding the living standards of the already impoverished. Unemployment is high and, according to official figures, around 60% of households are poor. In 1998 Venezuelans broke with the party system to elect populist left-winger Hugo Chavez, a former army officer who proclaimed a \"Bolivarian revolution\", named after South America's independence hero. Mr Chavez died in 2013, but was succeeded by his vice-president, Nicolas Maduro, who pledged to continue his policies. Socialist reform, political unrest and deep divisions characterised President Chavez's term in office. His supporters - known as \"chavistas\" - and his detractors both staged street protests. Venezuela profile - home Country profiles - home Country profiles compiled by BBC Monitoring Supporters said his economic reforms - including the nationalisation of much of the economy, especially the oil sector - and his expansion of social programmes helped the poor benefit from the country's oil export revenues. Critics say Chavista policies have harmed economic performance. Government controls setting fixed rates for buying and selling US dollars, introduced in 2003, have created a booming black currency market, causing shortages and fuelling inflation, which rose to over 50% a year in 2014. The authorities blame the rampant inflation on businesses undermining the system, and have responded with controls on prices and company profits. Critics believe this will only exacerbate distortions in the economy. Venezuela under Mr Chavez sought to strengthen its regional influence through diplomatic and economic overtures towards other South American and Caribbean nations. This has been seen, in part, as an effort to counter Washington's influence in the region, and has been a contributory factor to strained relations with US allies such as Colombia. Mr Chavez also aligned himself with Russia and Iran, and frequently expressed support for anti-Western leaders in the Middle East and elsewhere. A country of striking natural beauty, which ranges from the snow-capped Andean peaks in the west, through the Amazonian jungles in the south, to the beaches of the north, Venezuela is among the most highly urbanised countries in Latin America.

Since then, Houthi rebels within Yemen have launched a significant number of short-range ballistic missiles towards Saudi Arabia and other GCC military installations. Despite major efforts to negate Houthi ballistic missile assets through airstrikes, the tempo of ballistic missile activity does not appear to have abated.Interactive MapThis map shows the relative intensity of missile and missile defense-related activity across the Arabian Gulf which has occurred as part of the ongoing Yemen conflict. Beginning in June 2015, the bulk of these incidents have occurred along Yemen-Saudi border around the cities of Najran, Jizan and Abha, but Houthi acquisition of longer-range missiles have more recently permitted attacks as far as Riyadh. Saudi and UAE Patriot missile defenses have intercepted a very high percentage of these launches, greatly limiting damage. Significant activity has also been seen around Al-Mohka and the Straits of Bab-al Mandab, where Houthi-Saleh forces have repeatedly fired antiship cruise missiles at both Emirati and U.S. naval vessels.As of July 10, 2018, there have been 106 publicly reported intercepts of missiles fired from Yemen.Interactive TimelineThis timeline illustrates GCC coalition intercepts of ballistic missiles launched from within Yemen since the operation began. The Saudi coalition is employing PATRIOT ballistic missile defense units to defend against these strikes. Its first intercept of a ballistic missile fired by Yemeni forces occurred in June 2015. There have reportedly been over two dozen successful intercepts of Scud, Tochka, and other missiles deployed by forces within Yemen.

The former gives you an idea of the throughput of the drive during the time that it was running the test workload. This can be a very good indication of overall performance. What average data rate doesn't do a good job of is taking into account response time of very bursty (read: high queue depth) IO. By reporting average service time we heavily weigh latency for queued IOs. You'll note that this is a metric we have been reporting in our enterprise benchmarks for a while now. With the client tests maturing, the time was right for a little convergence.Given that the Extreme II was already dominating the Storage Bench 2013, it doesn't come as a surprise that the Extreme Pro is the new crownholder. Even the SSD 730 and Vector 150 can't challenge the Extreme Pro despite the fact that in terms of pure random write performance they are better. I think SanDisk's strength lies in mixed read\/write performance because write performance alone does not yield good results in real world workloads, which tend to be a mix of reads and writes.In fact, client workloads (like our Storage Benches) are usually more read-centric anyway and in the case of the Extreme Pro, the drive spent over three times longer processing read IOs than write IOs, which makes sense because there are nearly four times more read IOs than there are write IOs in the trace (even though in terms of gigabytes the difference is only twofold).","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":2821}

In addition to the ODI scores, we also collected information on patient demographics, comorbidities, duration of symptoms, intraoperative findings and complications, postoperative hospital stay, and any additional interventions required within the follow-up period. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify any significant predictors of functional outcome. We hypothesize that the majority of patients will experience significant improvement in their symptoms and subsequent increase in their ODI scores postoperatively, and that factors such as age, comorbidities, and duration of symptoms may have an impact on the overall outcome. The results of this study will provide valuable information for clinicians in developing countries regarding the effectiveness and potential complications of this surgical technique, as well as potential factors that may influence the outcome of their patients.

{"text":"For the complexity classes defined in this way, it is desirable to prove that relaxing the requirements on (say) computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems. This is because a larger set of problems would mean a wider range of computational possibilities, allowing for more efficient algorithms that may not necessarily conform to the stricter requirements. However, proving that one complexity class is strictly larger than another can be a challenging task and often requires careful analysis and mathematical techniques.\n\nOne approach to proving such relationships is through the use of reductions. A reduction is a transformation that maps instances of one problem to instances of another problem, in a way that preserves the solution. If we can show that a problem in one complexity class can be reduced to a problem in another, then the second problem must be at least as hard as the first, and so must belong to a larger complexity class.\n\nAnother approach is by examining the behavior of algorithms that solve problems in different classes. By measuring the time or space complexity of these algorithms, we can infer the relative difficulty of the problems they solve and use this to establish relationships between complexity classes.\n\nRegardless of the approach, the study of complexity classes is crucial in understanding the limitations and potential of computational systems, and in developing efficient algorithms for a wide range of applications.","prompt_len":170.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1474}

I wanted to see how Allen would follow up his magnificent film Match Point seeing as this is another one of his films shot in G.B. (which is unique among Allen's work) along with what seems to be his new muse Scarlett Johanson. Scoop is much lighter than MP and the humor is Scoop's most enjoyable aspect. The plot revolves around Johanson's character (a journalism student) who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave. She falls in love with a suspected serial killer (Jackman) and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding. Oh and all of this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by Allen.<br \/><br \/>I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed Johanson's performance but I am a bit bias, I could watch a three hour film with Johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted. She plays a ditsy, yappy, bumbling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of Allen's stereotypical neurosis stricken character. She adds appropriate body language for comic effect. Needless to say almost anyone who sees this will find Johanson's character sickeningly cute and that is a plus.<br \/><br \/>Allen is Allen... He is still playing the same character much like Chaplin and his Little Tramp character. Something that occur in this film makes me wonder if I will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however. He is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of late...<br \/><br \/>Jackman is also enjoyable as the suave, millionaire murder suspect. I cannot say that Jackman does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the less.<br \/><br \/>In terms of the plot I cannot help but feel that this is fresh... In fact it stinks of Curse of the Jade Scorpion. Johanson and Allen are more detective-like than anything. However I must applaud Allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding Hollywood version of this film. Instead of everything being black and white, things are painted in shades of gray. Being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does unequivocal guilt.

Many of them went to the United States. These emigrants included land-hungry peasants and workers from rural backgrounds, as well as artisans and shopkeepers hoping to make a new start. The reasons for their departure were varied but can be attributed to a combination of economic, social, and political factors. Germany was undergoing a period of rapid industrialization, which led to changes in the traditional patterns of work and living for many Germans. The growth of the industrial sector also caused a decline in the demand for agricultural goods, which meant that farmers had to find new ways of making a living.\n\nAdditionally, the country was experiencing a period of political upheaval. Bismarck's regime was characterized by an authoritarian style of governance, which included the repression of political opposition and the restriction of individual freedoms. This led to a general sense of discontent among many Germans, particularly those from liberal and socialist backgrounds.\n\nThe effects of this mass emigration were felt both in Germany and in the countries where the emigrants settled. In Germany, there was a shortage of skilled workers, particularly in the manufacturing sector. This had a negative impact on the economy and hindered the country's ability to compete with other industrialized nations.\n\nOn the other hand, the emigrants had a significant impact on the countries where they settled, particularly in the United States. Many of them brought with them valuable skills and work experience, which helped to stimulate growth in various industries.

He was earlier found guilty of attacking Ashley Hawkins with a hammer and a metal bar during the murder in Scotland Street in December last year. Davies and Mr Hawkins had arrived in the city from Wales as friends but before the attack the victim said Davies had held a knife to his throat. Addressing Davies, 28, at the High Court in Edinburgh, Lord Boyd said: \"You have been convicted on the clearest evidence of a particularly brutal murder. \"You continue to deny your guilt and you have shown little remorse.\" The judge acknowledged that Davies had a difficult upbringing and told him: \"You have not had the chances in life that may have set you on a different path.\" But he added: \"None of that excuses or mitigates the dreadful nature of this offence.\" Davies had denied murdering Mr Hawkins on 2 December. After he was found guilty of the crime he told security staff to take him down to the cells as the judge addressed him and accused the prosecutor of framing him. The final stage of the trial took place in the murderer's absence as Lord Boyd told jurors: \"Murder cases are always difficult. They are emotionally draining for everybody involved in it.\" Police were called to the flat in the early hours of the morning after neighbours heard banging and shouting coming from inside. One witness said he was aware of 15 to 20 bangs and screams which had stopped by the end of the disturbance. Police found Mr Hawkins, 32, from Barry, South Wales, dead in the flat with catastrophic head injuries. Unemployed Davies was the only other occupant in the locked property and was found topless, wearing jogging bottoms and trainers which were extensively stained with Mr Hawkins' blood. A Reebok top, which Davies had earlier been seen wearing, was found in a washing machine, saturated with the victim's blood, along with brain tissue. The court heard Mr Hawkins had suffered at least 24 blows to the head, and a metal pole and broken hammer recovered from the flat could have been used as weapons in the attack. Davies, a prisoner in Edinburgh, had also repeatedly stamped and kicked him on the head and body. Prosecutor David Taylor had told jurors: \"When police came into that locked flat there were two people there _ one alive, covered in blood and one dead, violently murdered. There is no mystery in this case.\" Davies told police that he had taken valium and claimed that he also taken heroin and ecstasy. A blood test later proved negative for ecstasy and opiate drugs but gave an indication that he had taken diazepam and cannabis. Davies claimed he was unconscious at the time of the killing. Defence counsel Keith Stewart QC, said: \"He maintains his position that he does not remember anything that happened in the flat.\" He asked the judge to deal with Davies on the basis that the murder was not a premeditated crime.

The long-standing rotation of Nato military jets in Lithuania has recently been stepped up in response to rising tensions with Russia over Ukraine. The UK government said the move would provide reassurance to Nato allies. The Typhoons will leave their base at RAF Coningsby on Monday morning and be joined by more than 100 RAF support staff in Lithuania. Only last week Typhoons based at RAF Leuchars in Fife intercepted two Russian bombers flying in international airspace off Scotland. The jets were sent to investigate the Russian planes which are understood to have turned away shortly afterwards. The MoD said fighter planes were scrambled to similar incidents eight times last year. The Typhoons' role over the Baltic states, which rely on Nato for fast jet support, will be similar. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the RAF fighters would provide reassurance to Nato allies at a time of heightened concern about Russia whose jets, the Pentagon has said, have already encroached into Ukraine's airspace. Last month, Mr Hammond told the Commons that the status of Ukraine was \"quite different\" from that of Nato countries.

Last year Brazilian prosecutors began probing whether American oil firms accepted bribes from Petrobras to win contracts in the country, as was alleged in an article published by the US magazine 'Outside the Beltway'. Brazilian authorities in May arrested American oil services executives Tom Glade and Willird Kies for their alleged involvement in the corruption scandal at Petrobras.\nThe company said the net loss from continuing operations was affected by the following charges: an asset impairment charge of $1.3bn, a gain on the sale of an asset of $2.3bn and interest expenses of $2.1bn in connection with the sale of shares of a subsidiary by Petrobras Empreendimentos SA.

Early versions were in use by 1851, but the most successful indicator was developed for the high speed engine inventor and manufacturer Charles Porter by Charles Richard and exhibited at London Exhibition in 1862. The steam engine indicator traces on paper the pressure in the cylinder throughout the cycle, which can be used to spot various problems and calculate developed horsepower. Since the steam engine indicator allows for a visual representation of the pressure in the cylinder throughout the cycle, it can be used to identify any inefficiencies or problems with the engine. For example, if the pressure in the cylinder drops too quickly or doesn't reach the expected maximum pressure, it may indicate a problem with the valves or seals. By analyzing the trace produced by the steam engine indicator, engineers can fine-tune the engine's performance to optimize efficiency and output. Additionally, the ability to calculate developed horsepower provides valuable information for determining the optimal load for the engine. Overall, the steam engine indicator revolutionized the study and improvement of steam engines, leading to increased efficiency and productivity in the industrial age.","prompt_len":491.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1304}

The AD baryogenesis scenario is a popular explanation for the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe. In this scenario, baryons are produced through the non-perturbative decay of a scalar field, known as the AD field. The AD field undergoes oscillations after inflation and can lead to the formation of non-topological solitons called Q-balls.\n\nQ-balls are neutral, stable, and can carry baryon number. They can be formed as a result of a scalar field that has a flat direction in its potential. The AD field is an example of a scalar field with a flat direction. Q-balls are formed if the AD field begins to oscillate with an amplitude larger than the value of the flat direction potential.\n\nQ-balls can have a significant impact on the late-time universe. They can dominate the energy density of the universe if they are long-lived. The decay of Q-balls can also produce interesting observational consequences such as the production of cosmic rays and gamma rays.\n\nIn summary, the formation and decay of Q-balls are important consequences of the AD baryogenesis scenario.

To do so, we will have to think beyond particular candidates and specific elections. We will have to think more radically, to propose more fundamental reforms. The Constitution of 1787 offers far too many nooks and crannies in the cobwebbed architecture of our political system in which Republicans can hide out and bide their time before attempting another hostile takeover of our democracy. Because the founders-approved option of amending the Constitution is, for the time being, unavailable to us, we will have to figure out ways of amending it without formally amending it, in order to end the artificially enhanced prominence of a party that has been so malignant in its current form. Ad PolicyFirst, we need a plan to immediately end the gerrymandering of congressional districts. Without taking this step, there could be no hope of returning the people's chamber to the people's hands. If we wait until after the next census, in 2020, it will be too late. By then, even if the Democrats win by a landslide in 2016, the GOP will have returned.For starters, if they do not take back the House of Representatives in the fall, Democrats should file lawsuits in the courts arguing that the gerrymandering of congressional districts is a violation of the Constitution, which nowhere explicitly confers on the states the power to gerrymander, or even to create congressional districts.","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":3069}

Additionally, they have a hybrid ownership-contract organization (more on that a bit below), and the Bengals have had a great relationship with owner Mike Brown because of the team's commitment to the community.\n\nHow do NFL teams maintain team identity?\n\nThis is one of the most intriguing questions surrounding franchise changing. In the first place, there is the question of how team owner-operatives are perceived by the media and fans in general. In addition, do NFL team owners like to talk about their teams in a positive way? There is no doubt that owners spend great pains every season crafting a narrative of their team and their organization. However, it would appear that owners would do well to try to maintain consistency and good PR in their team branding (this is certainly true for franchises like the Patriots). As a result, the NFL league office would likely try to help to improve the overall public perception of franchise changing.

{"text":"gravitating bodies significantly alter the flow pattern ( density and velocity ) of the gas that attempts to stream past . still , small protoplanets in the mars  super - earth range can only bind limited amounts of nebular gas ; until the so - called critical core mass has been reached ( @xmath0110 earth masses ) this gas is in near hydrostatic equilibrium with the nebula . here  we aim for a general description of the flow pattern surrounding these low - mass , embedded planets . As protoplanets grow and reach the critical core mass, they begin to gravitationally attract more gas from the surrounding nebula. This increase in mass causes a significant disruption in the flow pattern of the gas, as the protoplanet becomes more dominant in the local gravitational field. As a result, the gas begins to be captured by the protoplanet and forms an envelope around it. \n\nThis envelope can become dense enough to prevent light from passing through it, making the protoplanet appear as a dark silhouette against the background stars. Additionally, as the envelope becomes more massive, it can cause the protoplanet to undergo rapid and intense heating, due to the compressional heating of the accreting gas.\n\nThe flow pattern around these low-mass, embedded planets is also influenced by the rotation of the protoplanet and the surrounding nebula. This can cause the gas to spiral inward towards the protoplanet, creating a disk-like structure known as a protoplanetary disk. This disk can then go on to form the building blocks of planets and moons.\n\nOverall, the flow pattern surrounding low-mass, embedded planets is a complex and dynamic process that is influenced by a number of factors. As these planets continue to accrete mass and grow, they have a significant impact on the surrounding gas, and can go on to form some of the most fascinating objects in the universe.","prompt_len":486.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1878}

{"text":"But many of the problems of 2015 could get worse this year, from lack of demand for the continent's commodities, to lack of rain, from falling currencies to political instability. The editor of BBC Africa's Business Report, Matthew Davies, takes a look at the prospects for African economies in 2016: Prices for Africa's commodities fell sharply in 2015 and are not expected to see much of a recovery this year. This has had widespread economic effects across the continent. This decline in global demand from China has had a devastating effect on some of Africa's hardest hit countries.\n\nIn Ghana, the economy grew just 0.1% in 2014, according to the IMF. This year's estimate for Ghana's economy is 8% growth, says Davies. In neighbouring Nigeria, the economy grew by less than 1% in 2014. This rate of growth is far different from the 11% that the Ghanaian government was projecting for the year to June this year.\n\nAfricans have shown the resilience to weather difficult economic times, says Davies. For decades they have held onto their food production as the price of staple oil and other commodities has often dipped in these times of tight supply. However, as prices for key commodities have soared since the 2013 commodity price crunch, African economies have had to contend with the consequences in terms of price rises, economic growth and unemployment.\n\n\"The most important trend of 2014 was the impact of falling oil prices on African economies and the consequences this has had on the delivery of public services,\" says Davies. Nigeria and Ghana were especially impacted, he says.\n\n\"The price of petrol, for example, is now around 75% of the price seen just a few years ago. This is the impact of oil prices falling from $112 per barrel to $50 per barrel.\"\n\nWorries\n\nWorries about falling food production were growing as well. In South Sudan, for example, the government's latest assessment found that food prices would only rise by 13% in 2015 because of a supply disruption.

{"text":"Nearly a quarter of the present food industry workforce are from European countries outside the UK. The Federation warned of \"significant\" challenges following the vote to leave the EU and criticised the government for its lack of planning. The EU is the UK's largest market for exports of food and non-alcoholic drink, according to the FDF. Ian Wright, its director general, described Brexit as the UK's \"most significant peacetime challenge ever\". He said foreign industry workers needed to know they were wanted: \"The immediate priority for those workers is to support them through this deeply unpleasant climate of 'anti-foreigner' sentiment and to provide them with speedy reassurance that their future here is absolutely secure and their contribution is valued and warmly welcomed.\" He said he was deeply worried about access to the single market and EU workers, adding that many manufacturers would struggle to substitute existing EU customers for ones in other parts of the world because of differing consumer tastes and limited product shelf life. The FDF represents over 6,000 businesses with a workforce of nearly 400,000. At the Federation's first convention, Mr Wright said it was imperative that the industry had the ability to trade across the 27 EU nations without being impeded by tariffs if it was to remain competitive. He said it was also important to increase productivity and to ensure regulatory stability. The industry says it will need another 130,000 workers by 2024. Professor Tim Lang of the City University Centre for Food Policy, has studied the possible effects of a Brexit vote on the industry. He is dismayed by the lack of leadership coming from politicians and believes Brexit threatens the UK's \"food security\". He said the drop in the pound will increase the cost of imports in the short-term and that agriculture had come to depend on EU immigrants. \"We rely on foreign labour to produce our food, to grow it, to process it and look after it in the factories and as I said in a tweet, are those who voted for Brexit now prepared to go and work picking Brussel sprouts, cabbages and lifting potatoes in Lincolnshire?\" he said on Radio 4's Food Programme. But Tim Worstall, a senior fellow at the Adam Smith Institute, believes food prices will come down because the British government will be able to decide its own import tariffs rather than having to follow EU rules. He believes lessons can be learnt from farmers in New Zealand who lost most of their subsidies in the 1980s because of government budgetary cuts. The majority managed to restructure their businesses, sought new markets, and returned to profitability after a difficult period of transition. ","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":2697}

When Corliss was given the Rumford medal the committee said that \"no one invention since Watt's time has so enhanced the efficiency of the steam engine\". In addition to using 30% less steam, it provided more uniform speed due to variable steam cut off, making it well suited to manufacturing, especially cotton spinning. The Corliss steam engine was a crucial innovation in the Industrial Revolution, with its efficiency and reliability driving significant increases in production and profitability. It quickly became the standard for large-scale manufacturing, and its principles were later adapted and refined for use in other areas, such as shipping and rail transport. However, as the 20th century progressed, electric motors surpassed steam engines as the primary source of industrial power, and innovation in steam engine technology dwindled.

The innate immune system is present at birth, and therefore, it is not able to protect a new microbial community from infection. However, in response to antigenic stimulation it responds with the production of large quantities of immune system cells, and this results in the killing or prevention of infection of a variety of human pathogens. The innate immune system is also responsible for the creation of antibodies and peptides that mediate the initiation and propagation of immune responses to pathogens (7). There are, however, some factors of a bacterial (or fungal, or mammalian) origin that can damage, or even destroy, the innate immune system. These may be either direct chemicals or their metabolites. For instance, endotoxin may impair the ability of macrophages to release neutrophils and other types of immune cells. Also, toxins from certain pathogenic fungi may damage macrophages in a manner similar to those of bacterial endotoxins. In other cases, it has been suggested that low dose vitamin A deficiency in newborns may affect the survival and function of their innate immune system by a variety of mechanisms (8,9).

{"text":"a class of infinite horizon optimal control problems involving @xmath0-type cost functionals with @xmath1 is discussed . These problems are known as discounted cost problems, where @xmath1 is the discount factor. The goal is to find a control policy that minimizes the expected discounted cost over an infinite time horizon. The control policy is a function that maps the current state of the system to an action that minimizes the expected discounted cost. \n\nOne approach to solving these problems is to use dynamic programming. Specifically, the Bellman equation can be used to recursively compute the optimal value function, which gives the minimum expected discounted cost at each state. Once the optimal value function is known, the optimal control policy can be computed by finding the action that minimizes the expected discounted cost at each state, given the optimal value function. \n\nAnother approach is to use Pontryagin's maximum principle, which provides necessary conditions for optimality. This approach involves constructing the Hamiltonian function, which is a combination of the cost functional and the dynamics of the system. The maximum principle states that the optimal control policy must maximize the Hamiltonian function at each time point. \n\nBoth approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which one to use depends on the specific problem at hand. However, it is important to note that the optimal control problem may not always have a solution, or it may have multiple solutions. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully examine the problem and the assumptions made in order to ensure that the solution obtained is indeed the true optimal control policy.","prompt_len":120.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1706}

The helicopter directed officers on the ground to the boat, where they briefly exchanged gunfire shortly before 7 p.m.Police halted their gunfire and sent hostage negotiators to try and talk Tsarnaev out of the boat Davis said.But the suspect was not responsive, and after about an hour and 45 minutes, officers went to the boat and took Tsarnaev into custody.His arrest sparked a spontaneous celebration in Watertown with people high fiving police, chanting Boston strong and USA. Tsarnaev was quickly transported to a hospital in serious condition for treatment of injuries sustained during the recent manhunt. He was the sole remaining suspect in the bombings at the Boston Marathon, which resulted in the death of three people and injured over 260 others. Authorities believe that Tsarnaev fled and went into hiding after the bombings with the help of his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed in a shoot-out with police earlier during the day. The manhunt intensified yesterday when the details of a violent carjacking and car chase emerged. The owner of the car, an SUV, was able to escape the car, which was driven by the younger Tsarnaev and called 911, setting off a chain of events that led to the capture of Tsarnaev last night.

REUTERS\/Indian Ministry of Defence\/Handout via ReutersThe explosion in a weapons store in the forward section of the Russian-built INS Sindhurakshak on Tuesday night caused a fire so hot it melted steel as the vessel lay berthed in Mumbai, resulting in the navy's worst loss in more than four decades.\"The bodies are severely disfigured and not identifiable due to severe burns. The bodies have been sent to INHS Ashiwini, the naval hospital for DNA identification,\" spokesman Narendra Vispute told reporters.In an earlier statement, the navy said the heat of the exploding weapons made it unlikely anybody inside could have survived.The sinking of the diesel-powered submarine is the biggest blow for the navy, both in terms of lives and the loss of a vessel, since a frigate was sunk in the 1971 war with Pakistan.It has turned the spotlight on the navy's ageing submarine fleet even as it spends billions of rupees on aircraft carriers to counter the rising influence of the Chinese navy in the Indian Ocean.The Sindhurakshak is a Kilo class vessel, which were built in former Soviet and later Russian shipyards for the Indian navy from 1985 to 2000. The navy has 10 of the submarines and four German HDW boats.A defense source said the navy did not have a deep submergence rescue vehicle that other navies use to save trapped sailors, although in this case the incident occurred while it was docked and not in the deep seas.The navy said divers could not enter the Sindhurakshak for more than 12 hours because of boiling water inside parts of the vessel. Access was \"almost impossible due to jammed doors and hatches, distorted ladders, oily and muddy waters\".Only one diver could work at a time initially to clear a path inside the submarine. Divers are trying to reach further inside to find the remaining bodies, the navy said.A naval board of inquiry has been ordered into how weapons went off while the vessel was berthed in the high-security Mumbai base.Weapons on board such a submarine include torpedoes and missiles that are launched over long ranges above water.","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":2499}

{"text":"At first glance, it makes sense that in this seaside town with its beach culture, there would be plenty of street food vendors selling to both tourists and residents. But many of them did not open because entrepreneurs were discovering a new niche. These trucks belong to people who have lost their jobs and used their compensation money to start a new business. In fact, on weekdays, most food trucks are just parked around town and closed as there aren't many customers. In just under two years, this city of 239,000 saw about 22,000 jobs disappear. Many of the unemployed who did not buy food trucks or venture into new business simply left town. Macae is one of the many cities on Brazil's south-east coast that has seen its dreams of oil-spurred wealth destroyed by the cruel reality of the country's oil crisis that started in 2014. Brazil's oil reserves are buried deep beneath the seabed, miles from the coast. So places like Macae are home to a large number of people who work on the offshore oil platforms and drilling ships. Since the 1970s, when Brazil's state oil giant Petrobras started its offshore operations here, this sleepy fishing town has seen an influx of highly skilled workers, such as engineers, chemists and professional divers. Anita Gomide and her husband started their commercial diving firm Tecsubsea in 2011 to service the oil platforms. During the good years, they would have up to two jobs a week - each of them requiring a team of at least three divers. But now they say they are lucky to get one job a month. \"Every six months we sit down and consider shutting down our company,\" says Anita. \"Then we decide, 'Let's just carry on for six months more and see what happens.' We've been doing this for a long time.\" Tecsubsea is still operating, but many of its competitors have dropped out. The upside of this crisis, Anita jokes, is that Macae is now a much nicer place to live, with less traffic and more affordable housing. At the local port, most commercial boats that service the oil industry are anchored in the dock. The only vessels in high demand are the fishing ones. Evanildo Faria, of Patricia Mar Transport, takes people and equipment out to the drilling ships and platforms. He says demand has fallen by about 80% and he has had to fire many employees. \"We've been in this business for four decades. I have never seen things this bad.\" At the heart of Macae's boom and bust cycle is Petrobras - Brazil's state oil giant. The euphoria with Petrobras started in 2006, when the company announced massive new oil reserves in the so-called \"pre-salt\" layer of rocks - some 4,000m beneath the seabed of the Atlantic Ocean (itself up to 3,000m deep at this point). The new oil find was supposed to turn Brazil into one of the wealthiest non-Opec oil producers. Over the years, under the leadership of former Presidents Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff, lawmakers changed the law to ensure that Petrobras would be the main operator here, and that the royalties it paid would go on health and education spending. Markets rallied with Brazil's good fortune. In 2010, at the height of the global euphoria with Brazilian oil, Petrobras raised $70bn (about \u00c2\u00a346bn at the time) in what was then the world's largest public share offering. But today the company holds a very different record: it has the highest debt of any corporation in the world - in both relative and absolute terms. Its debt of $120bn is more than five times bigger than its ability to generate cashflow. A number of factors contributed to Petrobras's downfall over the years. In 2014, a major corruption scandal revealed that $2bn had been stolen from the company by executives and politicians. It took Petrobras seven months to produce a credible balance sheet. But corruption was just one factor. Petrobras had also been subsidising domestic petrol prices. The government, which holds the majority of the company's shares, used this policy to hold down inflation. It may have helped keep retail prices down, but it came at great cost to Petrobras. International markets did not help either. Oil prices tumbled as China's economy slowed. New onshore shale gas projects became far more competitive than expensive offshore investments. Since June, a few weeks after Ms Rousseff stepped down from government during her impeachment trial, the new government of President Michel Temer has been moving fast in its bid to reform Petrobras and the sector. It has pressed on with changes initiated by Ms Rousseff to prevent further corruption scandals - now key company decisions have to be scrutinised by a number of executives and committees. Crucially the company says it will sell off $15bn in assets - including its biofuel operations. And Brazil's Congress is moving to remove Petrobras's privileges when it comes to the pre-salt oil, allowing foreign multinationals a bigger role. In Macae, where the economy is closely linked to the future of Petrobras, people are divided over the reforms. \"I think these reforms will have a great effect here,\" says Anita Gomide. \"But we are not sure about how quickly they will come. It will open up new jobs and companies that we have lost over the years.\" But the oil workers' trade unions disagree. They have launched campaigns and strikes against President Temer's reforms, accusing him of giving away prized assets to foreign firms. Marcelo Abrahao, director of Sindipetro union, says the government has the means to seek loans and new cash to invest in Petrobras. \"Petrobras should not be run like a private company. Its purpose is much greater than just to seek profits,\" he says. Pedro Parente, the man appointed by President Temer to reform Petrobras, says no-one is happy with what was done in the past with the company, and that it is still suffering from the effects of past decisions and crises. But he says once Petrobras reduces its debt by selling assets and scaling down investments, it will grow once again. \"In five years, this company will be bigger than it is today in its main area - oil and gas,\" says Mr Parente. Most people in Macae, even those who are not fully behind his plans, hope that this prediction at least will come true for the sake of Brazil's beleaguered oil capital.

{"text":"Mr Trump had developed a story line around the Paris Agreement, which calls on all nations to help stop the warming of the planet. He said some time ago that he would decide whether the US would stay in the accord or withdraw. Last week, his aides told me, he was mulling over his decision. The end of the drama came on Thursday afternoon in the Rose Garden: Mr Trump announced that the US would withdraw from the accord. He said that his decision marked \"a resurgence of American sovereignty\", and people in the front row cheered. He also said he was working for \"Pittsburgh - not Paris.\" One member of the audience, Jim Martin, who wore a Marines baseball cap, called out the name of another city: \"Hazard, Kentucky.\" He told me later he's the son of a coal miner, and he was born and raised there. While Mr Trump talked, he stood at a podium and gripped both sides. He leaned in towards the mic. You could hear a popping sound when he said the words loudly. Five effects of US pullout from Paris climate deal Trump seeks new 'fair' climate deal However you felt about the Paris, Pittsburgh, or the climate-change accord, it was a dramatic show. The president stood under a blue sky with puffy clouds - and a sun so bright that it made cotton dresses warm to the touch. Those who were dressed in jackets and ties were sweating. The mood, as one of the guests of the president said earlier, was: \"Hot.\" The production was put on for a small - but important - audience that was made up of the president's supporters. Stephen Bannon, the president's chief strategist, sat in the front section and clapped and smiled. (He also looked sunburned). He sat near HR McMaster, the national security adviser, and other aides. One of the guests wore sunglasses on top of her head and carried a mobile phone with a sticker on the back that said: \"classified\". Many of these guests belonged to a backstage crew, the men and women who write the president's scripts and help him deliver his lines. The show - like all of the president's productions - was grounded in real-time policymaking and demonstrated how the president operated. \"He cares about the environment,\" Gary Cohn, the director of the national economic council, told me and other reporters on Air Force One during the president's trip through Europe last week. Yet, as Cohn said, he was listening to people on both sides of the arguments - those who supported the accord and those who saw only its flaws. The staff members also represented two factions of the Trump administration. The globalists, those who want the US to play a robust role on the world stage, supported the accord. The anti-globalists, those who believe in national sovereignty and place US interests above all, wanted the US out. The president chose to consider the issue in a public manner, and turn the debate into an on-going drama that showcased the philosophical divide at the White House - and the president's role as the decider. The process highlighted the president's managerial style. To put it simply, he loves the muddle: as insiders have told me, he doesn't give special credence to one advisor over another. Instead he asks nearly all of his advisors what they think about an issue and lets them fight it out. Then he makes up his mind. Insiders tell me that the president thrives in a volatile environment. They admit that the process is messy, though, and they tell me that at least half of the discord at the White House is simply that - unpredictable, roiling chaos - rather than any sort of grand strategy of presidential policymaking. For some who work at the White House, it's fun. They're the anti-globalists, and they like operatic scenes. They are high-spirited actors in the White House show. Pretty much every time I've seen Bannon, for example, he's been smiling (and trying to smooth down his hair, which somehow always looks messy). He thrives on the unpredictable nature of the Trump administration, and has contributed to it. As one senior staffer told me, sounding exasperated: \"He's for the deconstruction of the administrative state.\" Yet most of those who work at the White House are not nihilists - not by a long shot. They're bureaucrats, and they've devoted their lives to the idea of administrative order. They often look as though they're under stress - and off stage, before the cameras start rolling, they sometimes snap at the people around them. Critics of the administration say there's another problem - and it's not the stagecraft or dramas that unfold backstage. They say the president is impulsive and cares about the way he's seen, not about any particular issue, whether it's the environment or anything else. They say that the big production about the accord this week was designed for one reason: to distract people from problems the president has been facing - from rumours about Russia ties to the FBI shakeup - and to ensure he's on centre stage. David Cay Johnston, the author of The Making of Donald Trump, said that the president is not \"sifting through policy\", and that he doesn't have a philosophy about the government. \"The only '-ism' that Trump knows is Trumpism,\" says Mr Johnston. Trump likes to turn issues like the climate-change accord into a show because it throws people off balance, said Mr Johnston, and it makes him seem as though he's the one in charge. \"He creates this impression of being a strong leader in a black-and-white world,\" Johnston said. \"But the world is mostly grey.\" Others said that the drama the president creates around his work at the White House masks an underlying danger: the policies themselves. \"It's a great show,\" Timothy O'Brien, the author of Trump Nation: The Art of Being the Donald added. But, he said, it's like standing on a corner and seeing someone in the window, threatening to jump. \"It is compelling,\" he said. \"But no-one really wants to watch the outcome.\" ","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":5895}

{"text":"And that was before the threat of deeper sanctions following the loss of a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet, said to have been shot down by pro-Russian separatists. What impact could further sanctions have on Russia's already fragile economy? The \"fear factor\" is the main threat, according to analysts. \"The sanctions so far are fairly modest,\" Alex Nice, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit told the BBC. \"They don't prevent the day-to-day operations of Russian companies, which for example, are still able to access US dollar clearing, but the longer term damage is the perception of risk. \"This will reinforce a more sceptical approach to investment. It's likely to be depressed compared to what it could be,\" Mr Nice said. There is clear evidence that investors are pulling money out of Russia. In the first six months of this year, a staggering $75bn (\u00c2\u00a344bn) left the country, according to Russia's central bank. This is already more than the $63bn of capital pulled out during the whole of last year. Both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimate capital flight may exceed $100bn by the end of the year if the Ukraine crisis continues. For Russia this is a big problem as it needs foreign money. The long economic boom, which justified its designation as the \"R\" in the fast-growing emerging Bric economies alongside Brazil, India and China, is now dwindling. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Economist Intelligence Unit both predict Russia's economy will grow just 0.5% for this year, while the IMF expects just 0.2% expansion. It is a far cry from the 8.5% growth Russia saw in 2007, when strong energy exports helped to fuel domestic consumption. \"The previous drivers of the Russian economy - consumer spending and oil exports - are both exhausted and it needs a new driver based on a higher level of investment spending,\" says Chris Weafer, senior partner at economic consultancy firm Macro Advisory. \"Russia cannot afford to remain in isolation for too long,\" he said. \"The big problem is not the effect of the official sanctions. It is the fact that they have generated a great deal of risk aversion which has slowed down investment into the country and made it more expensive for Russian firms to do deals.\" However, many analysts remain confident that, over the long term, the Russian economy will bounce back. \"This is a country with 144 million people. It is already the world's fifth biggest consumer and the middle class is growing. Nothing can happen which is serious enough to dislodge firms making money there in the long term,\" says Mr Weafer. There are already signs that he may be right. The rouble, which fell 9% in the first two months of the year, has recovered slightly to trade 6% lower for the year to date. Russian stock markets are also down, losing 12% so far this year compared to the 6% gain on the benchmark MSCI emerging markets index as a whole. But the recent decline has not been as dramatic as the falls that followed the start of the crisis in Ukraine, when Moscow annexed Crimea in March. \"If you want to participate in this market you have to be a risk taker. There is a bit of stability after significant selling pressure last week,\" says Sebastien Barbe, head of emerging market foreign exchange strategy at Credit Agricole. In the short term, however, the Russian economy is expected to continue to stagnate. \"Investors will remain very nervous of Russia risk until there is some clarity. The major risk is the continuing self sanctions by foreign investors, businesses and banks,\" says Mr Weafer. \"To a limited extent, the state can substitute for foreign lenders in strategic sectors. However, without a big pick-up in inward investment the economy will not be able to move to the sustained 3% to 4% annualised growth it needs,\" he said.

{"text":"Culture Of Psychological Science At StakeEnlarge this image iStockphoto iStockphotoIn a video released today at Edge.org, psychologist Simone Schnall raises interesting questions about the role of replication in social psychology and about what counts as \"admissible evidence\" in science.Schnall comes at the topic from recent experience: One of her studies was selected for a replication attempt by a registered replication project, and the replication failed to find the effect from her original study.An occasional failure to replicate isn't too surprising or disruptive to the field \u2014 what makes Schnall's case somewhat unique is the discussion that ensued, which occurred largely on blogs and social media. And it got ugly.The authors of the replication study shared their findings \u2014 which they called an \"epic fail\" \u2014 in a blog post prior to publication; Schnall identified potential problems with the replication and with the peer-review process (or its absence); more and more researchers analyzed and re-analyzed the data in question; some applauded the unfolding saga as scientific progress; some thought things got mean-spirited and personal. And in a widely discussed tweet, Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert described the \"replication police\" as \"shameless little bullies.\"In the new video \u2014 from a talk she gave to a group of social scientists in September \u2014 Schnall considers the different levels of scrutiny received by different researchers and for different findings. She draws on the legal distinction made by Herbert Packer in 1964 \u2014 the distinction between \"due process\" models of law, for which the burden of proof is very high and the focus is on avoiding wrongful convictions, and \"crime control\" models of law, for which the burden of proof is much lower and the aim is to prevent any perpetrators from slipping through.\"Crime control comes from crisis,\" says Schnall. The U.S. Patriot Act might be seen as a legal example and the \"replication police\" as a scientific example stemming from social psychology's so-called replication crisis. If the culture of replication in scientific psychology is adopting a crime control model, then results that are false positives are the culprits, with a low standard of evidence required to bring a published result under suspicion.Schnall's legal analogy raises a more general point. There are different kinds of errors in science: type I errors, or false positives, and type II errors, or failures to detect real effects. Norms for acceptable risk are determined by statistical practices within the field, such as considering a finding statistically significant when the probability of observing a result at least that extreme by chance is under 5 percent. If this number were lower, type I errors would decrease, but type II errors would become more common. If it were higher, type II errors would decrease, but type I errors would become more common.With the failed replication of the Schnall study, part of what made the fallout so ugly was the sense that scientists, rather than studies, were on trial. You see, when it comes to evaluating our scientific peers, it's not so clear how to assess acceptable risk. A culture of trust might let in too","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":3215}

In conclusion, the probiotic intervention that provided high doses of L. reuteri or B. longum changed the microbiota composition in vaginal fluid in a dose-dependent manner, with no significant association between the intervention and self-reported discomfort with stool consistency.\n\nThe probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri DSM17529 may cause mild to moderate vaginal discomfort, but these results are only suggestive and require further research.

After a troubled gestation during which its creator resigned, BankAmericard went on to become the first successful credit card; that is, a financial instrument that was usable across a large number of merchants and also allowed cardholders to revolve a balance (earlier financial products could do one or the other but not both). The success of BankAmericard led to its expansion across the United States and eventually to its rebranding as Visa in 1976. Other competitors like Mastercard and American Express also emerged in the credit card market, leading to increased competition and innovation in the industry. Today, credit cards are an essential part of our financial system and offer a variety of benefits to consumers, including loyalty rewards, fraud protection, and the ability to build credit. However, credit card debt is also a major issue, with many cardholders struggling to pay off their balances and falling into financial difficulties.

The proposed method for quickest detection of signals in this system is based on the consensus-based distributed detection framework. The sensors exchange their observations with their neighbors and collaboratively make the detection decision. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through simulations and compared with other existing methods. The results show that the consensus-based distributed detection method outperforms the other methods in terms of detection speed and accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed method is robust to sensor failures and network topology changes.

{"text":"Extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner. This is primarily accomplished through normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning. Thus a rock unit can be made to stretch and to become thinner. The thinning (thinness) of a rock unit is also affected by the fact that rock units tend to slide on their own faces. A small rock unit on its face can be easily pulled into a more extended rock unit with more extended face, thus making a bigger unit. By increasing friction between units and increasing the diameter of the ductile portions of the rock units, the rock unit is made to stretch and become thinner. As such, the rock units are made to be shorter, and there is an increase in the diameter and\/or in length. Thus, in the above example, the rock unit is made to become shorter and thinner.\n\n\nIn a later stage of the invention, the rock units are made to become longer, larger, and more ductile and to therefore cause the rock units to be very thin. This is accomplished because of the ductile effect of rock units. In this regard, the rock unit becomes even thinner after each fracture occurs. In particular, the fracture between the two rock units becomes even more extreme and that between the rock unit itself is even more extreme. This is because of the ductility of the rock units. This ductility is further increased through the use of ductile material that has been formed by the fracturing, thus making the rock, as it were, to be ductile.

Pretty Woman for me does two things, two terrible horrible ghastly things, firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer, you know with absolutely great friends, leg warmers lots of giggling, borrowing each others make up. You see in the reality of Pretty Woman the prostitute and this is a street walker Prostitute we're talking about here, has a great life, she's healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament. My feeling is this 'happy Hooker' type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character, which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it? If I make a film about a chef but don't want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place? By bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have, what a cop out, really really lame. <br \/><br \/>Secondly, 'Pretty Woman' insults romance itself, Edward Lewis played by Richard Gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this 'lady' that is without his plastic friend, yep don't leave home without it, especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another, even when he first meets her it's the Lotus Esprit turbo that does all the work, necklaces here diamonds there limos over there, money money money, where's the charm? where's the charisma, don't mention that attempt at the piano please.<br \/><br \/>Girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most.

Myles Hippolyte went close and John Baird missed a penalty before Peter Grant's powerful header levelled it. Falkirk pressed hard for a winner but Tony Gallacher's header hit the bar. They remain six points clear in fourth place, but are now three points behind Morton in third. Falkirk had two early chances to take the lead, Hippolyte blasting over from six yards after good build-up play involving Mark Kerr and Bob McHugh, before Baird's left-foot strike was parried by Greg Fleming and Tom Taiwo's follow-up effort was blocked. Harkins had a half-chance at the back post for the visitors from a Brian Gilmour free-kick from the right, but his effort from a tight angle was well saved by Danny Rogers. But after 24 minutes Harkins found a way past the Bairns keeper to give the Honest Men the breakthrough. Kevin Nisbet's head-flick caused hesitation in the home defence and Harkins pounced to round Rogers and blast home from the angle of the six-yard box. Baird and McHugh both went close for Falkirk before an equaliser eventually arrived in dramatic circumstances in first-half stoppage time. Falkirk were awarded a penalty after Scott McKenna bundled McHugh to the ground, but Baird's spot-kick was superbly saved by Greg Fleming, who turned it round his right-hand post. But from the resultant corner kick, Kerr's delivery found Grant, who rose highest to send a powerful header into the net. Nisbet twice came close to nudging Ayr back in front after the interval. He was thwarted by Rogers after a powerful run and shot before curling an effort inches wide of the target. Bairns boss Peter Houston changed his main strikers, bringing on Lee Miller and Scott Shepherd for McHugh and Baird as he searched for a winner. A late flurry almost produced it as Kerr had a shot cleared off the line before fellow full-back Gallacher watched his header come back off the crossbar. Falkirk boss Peter Houston: \"The frustrating thing for me is we are giving cheap goals away. We should win the first header and then Gary Harkins runs off of Peter Grant and that can't happen.

As I watched the movie, I was transported back to the era of gangsters, flappers, and fedoras. I was hooked on the witty dialogues, the colorful fictional characters, and the exaggerated action sequences. The movie had a unique charm that I hadn't seen before.\n\nI was curious about the origins of the movie and its iconic protagonist, so I researched and found out that Dick Tracy was a comic book created by Chester Gould in 1931. The character was a tough and intelligent detective who fought against organized crime and corruption with the help of his gadgetry and allies.\n\nI realized that Dick Tracy was not only a movie but a cultural phenomenon that spanned several decades. The character had been adapted into comic strips, radio plays, TV shows, video games, and even Broadway musicals. Many actors, directors, and musicians had been involved with the brand, such as Warren Beatty, Madonna, Danny Elfman, and Stephen Sondheim.\n\nI was impressed by the legacy of the franchise and the impact it had on the media landscape. I felt like I had discovered a hidden gem that deserved more recognition and appreciation. I wanted to share my newfound fascination with others and introduce them to the world of Dick Tracy.\n\nIn conclusion, my impromptu decision of buying Dick Tracy turned out to be a rewarding and enlightening experience. It showed me that sometimes taking a chance on something unfamiliar can lead to unexpected and delightful discoveries. I would recommend the movie to anyone who enjoys crime fiction, pulp novels, or retro aesthetics.","prompt_len":155.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1710}

{"text":"With the windows down, I sang along to cheesy Mediterranean songs on the radio, watching the scenery flash by. But I was there to make a documentary about Europe dancing to a worrying tune - popular discontent, fear, anger and, in many corners, an absence of hope. There is always a section in society that feels abandoned or ignored by their government, but after the 2008 crash, the bank bailouts, the migrant crises and a string of terror attacks, a growing number of Europeans have felt unprotected, exposed and worried for the future of their families. And the answer to their fears? Well if my Fiat 500 were Europe - bear with me on this one - it would be hesitating at a crossroads. The signpost pointing one way reads Angela Merkel. And in the opposite direction, Marine Le Pen. These two determined women, tough and seasoned politicians, both standing for election this year, hope to drag their own countries and Europe as a whole down dramatically different paths. A passionate European and Christian Democrat, mindful of the horrors of her country's Nazi and Cold War past, Ms Merkel is increasingly viewed as the continent's number one defender of liberal values. Barack Obama pointedly chose to visit her in Berlin on his last official trip abroad before handing over the presidency to Donald Trump. Ms Le Pen, on the other hand, is the poster child of Europe's new wave of populism. She demands what she described to me in an interview as a \"new world order\". A new France, a new Europe, free, she says, of the \"prison\" of the European Union and the \"artificial\" joining of European nations. She laughed at those wringing their hands on both sides of the Atlantic over the Trump Presidency. Brexit, Trump and Europe's new \"patriotic leaders\" in Ms Le Pen's words, are merely the end of one world and the start of a new one where, in her opinion, the people and the nation state are strong and don't answer to what she called \"Globalisationists\". Gone are the days in the not so distant past when national elections met a wall of public indifference - 2017 has been dubbed 'Election Year' in Europe, with key EU nations Germany, France, the Netherlands and possibly Italy heading to the polls. With populist parties standing strong, those for and against them feel motivated to vote. And not just with their pockets in mind. The famous campaign slogan, \"it's the economy, stupid\", associated with Bill Clinton's successful 1992 presidential bid, is no longer pertinent. Look at the Netherlands - holding an election next month. The economy there is on the up and unemployment is down. But rather than flocking around their centrist prime minister, voters are flirting with anti-immigration, Eurosceptic populist, Geert Wilders. Wherever you look at the moment in Europe - north, south, east and west - there are populist parties shouting loudly from the sidelines. The Five Star Movement is Italy's most talked-about political party right now. They listen to people, they say, not Big Business, and their message is captivating the country's disenchanted, from all ages and backgrounds. \"Populism is a beautiful world,\" Beppe Grillo, the figurehead of the movement, told me. \"I am proud to be a populist. It means we are saying No! No! and No! and we will win the next election.\" A nostalgic nationalist, anti-immigration, vein runs through most of Europe's populist parties but their policies vary from country to country. It is incorrect to describe them all as \"far right\". Even the parties which have deep roots in the extreme right, such as Austria's Freedom Party or Ms Le Pen's Front National, have tried to broaden their appeal, declaring they are of the people, not right or left. \"Au nom du peuple\" (in the name of the people) is the banner under which Ms Le Pen is running her presidential campaign in France. And after the Francois Fillon fiasco in France, with the centre-right's presidential candidate damaged by corruption allegations, Ms Le Pen has a chance of making it to her country's highest political office. And that would be a dramatic turning point for Europe - she says she wants out of the euro and probably of the EU. \"Frexit\" could bring down the whole EU like a house of cards. In Brussels, even insiders admit the EU is in a battle to survive. Before stepping down as president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz told me there was a \"real risk\" that the EU would fall apart. Vice President of the European Commission Federica Mogherini said: \"We have something that the entire world regards as a miracle. We have an enormous strength and we spend our time talking about our own crisis.\" Next month is the EU's 60th birthday, with lavish celebrations planned in Rome. But outside the birthday party gates the EU's existence is being seriously questioned. And there is a global significance to all this too. Europe's populists are for the most part big fans of Presidents Putin and Trump, and a weak, fractured Europe works for both men. With many Europeans nervous about the Trump presidency and with so much at stake, it could be that even angry voters feel safer sticking with the political mainstream this year. But predict at your peril. Polls have proved unreliable. Europe's voters are in a volatile mood. You can watch After Brexit: the Battle for Europe on BBC Two on Thursday 9 February, 21:00 GMT.

The designation Ju 87 C applied to a handful of Ju 87 B converted for the never finished carrier Graf Zeppelin.

{"text":"In 1929, director Walt Disney and animator Ub Iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their \"\"Silly Symphonies\"\" series, \"\"The Skeleton Dance\"\". Iwerks and Disney had been collaborating together since the early 20s, in Disney's \"\"Laugh-O-Gram\"\" cartoon series; however, their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when Iwerks accepted an offer by a competitor to leave Disney and start his own animation studio. That was the birth of Celebrity Productions, where Iwerks continued developing his style and technique (and where he created the character of Flip the Frog). While his work kept the same high quality, it wasn't really popular and by 1936 the studio was closed. Later that year, Iwerks was hired by Columbia Pictures, and Iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance, this time in color.<br \/><br \/>1937's \"\"Skeleton Frolics\"\" is essentially, a remake of the 1929 classic \"\"The Skeleton Dance\"\", the movie that borough him fame and fortune. Like that short film, it is set on an abandoned graveyard, where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play. The dead rise from their coffins, ready for the show that's about to begin, as a group of skeletons has formed an orchestra, and begin to play a happy tune. Now, it's not easy to be a musician made of just bones, as some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts, however, the band manages to put a good show and another group of skeletons begin to dance. A lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra: it's hard to dance with loose body parts. Everything ends at dawn, and just when the sun is about to rise again, the skeletons run towards their graves.<br \/><br \/>Directed and animated by Ub Iwerks himself, \"\"Skeleton Frolics\"\" follows faithfully the pattern set by \"\"The Skeleton Dance\"\" years before, although with a crucial difference: Iwerks did the whole film in Technicolor. The bright tonalities allowed Iwerks to create a more visually appealing film, and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving Disney, creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those he conceived before. It is certainly a more experimental film than \"\"The Skeleton Dance\"\", although sadly, this doesn't mean it's necessarily a better film. For starters, the film is practically identical to the one he did with Disney, with the only differences being the music (more on that later) and the color effects. It looks beautiful, no doubt about it, but it definitely feels kind of unoriginal after all.<br \/><br \/>However, it is not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurts the film (after all, Iwerks executes it in a wonderful way), but the fact that the musical melody created by Joe DeNat for the film is pretty uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one done by Carl W. Stalling for \"\"The Skeleton Dance\"\". In other words, while DeNat's tune is effective and appropriate for the theme, it's easy to forget about it rapidly while Stalling's song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable. Being a musical film, this is of high importance, and so the mediocrity of the music brings down Iwerk's flawless work of animation. Personally, I think that with a better musical accompaniment, \"\"Skeleton Frolics\"\" would be remembered as fondly as \"\"The Skeleton Dance despite not being as groundbreaking, as it's still a fun film to watch.<br \/><br \/>It's kind of sad that most of the work Iwerks did after leaving Disney is now forgotten due to his poor success, however, it must be said that if Iwerks lacked the popularity of Disney or Fleischer (Disney's main rival), he did not lack the quality of those companies' films. It was probably just a case of bad luck what made the man who gave life to Disney's mouse for the first time to face failure out of Disney. Despite its shortcomings, \"\"Skeleton Frolics\"\" is a very funny and visually breathtaking film, that while not exactly the most original and fresh film (one just can't help but thinking of \"\"The Skeleton Dance\"\" while watching it), it definitely reminds us that Iwerk's skeletons are still here to haunt us, and inspire us.<br \/><br \/>8\/10\"","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":4277}

She attacked Justice Anthony Kennedy's controlling opinion for seeking to \"sit back and wish away\" racial inequalities, and she dismissed Chief Justice John Roberts' arguments against race-conscious policies as \"out of touch with reality.\"In response, Roberts filed a concurring opinion defending himself against Sotomayor's charges. \"People can disagree in good faith on this issue, but it similarly does more harm than good to question the openness and candor of those on either side of the debate,\" Roberts wrote.Justice Antonin Scalia also jumped in the mix, writing that Sotomayor's allusion to the Jim Crow era in the context of affirmative action was \"doubly shameful.\"Supreme Court experts say this level of personal animosity over race is unprecedented.\"I don't recall anything like this involving Thurgood Marshall and another Justice,\" said Guy-Uriel Charles, the founding director of Duke University School Of Law's Center on Law, Race and Politics. \"Marshall certainly took on his fellow conservative justices on race, but nothing that I recall elicited the type of exchange that we saw between Roberts and Sotomayor.\"Marshall, the first back justice who served from 1967 to 1991, was a celebrated civil rights lawyer who persuaded the Supreme Court to ban state-sponsored segregation.

{"text":"On 1 February 2007, the eve of the publication of IPCC's major report on climate, a study was published suggesting that temperatures and sea levels have been rising at or above the maximum rates proposed during the last IPCC report in 2001. The study compared IPCC 2001 projections on temperature and sea level change with observations. Over the six years studied, the actual temperature rise was near the top end of the range given by IPCC's 2001 projection, and the actual sea level rise was above the top of the range of the IPCC projection.\n\nA previous report by UK scientists in 2004 had suggested that the IPCC's 2001 projections were too high for the time being. However, a new study by UK scientists claims to have more accurate numbers than the earlier report, and suggests that there was a major underestimation of global warming during the 1990's. (Global warming slowed sharply after warming began, a study finds.)\n\nHere are all the facts for you.\n\nIPCC 2001 Projection\n\nThe 2001 IPCC report, released in September, proposed an estimated rise of between 0.6\u00b0 and 1.0\u00b0C (0.9\u00b0 to 3.4\u00b0F) by 2100, if emissions of greenhouse gases stopped.

Its author Vicky Brotherton said having children made victims more vulnerable, but the UK was \"blind to this\". Home Office minister Karen Bradley said victims were offered tailored support. The report - by the Anti-Trafficking Monitoring Group - said the provision of access to safe accommodation, specialist healthcare and support for children was not being systematically provided. It said some children had to be present during their parent's asylum interviews, often when abuse is disclosed to officials. The report said: \"Trafficked parents are very vulnerable to further exploitation as traffickers often use threats against a victim's child to maintain control over them. \"Yet the government's response to trafficking fails to recognise trafficking victims who are pregnant or have children as being particularly vulnerable.\" Research by the 12 charities - including Amnesty International, Anti-Slavery International and Unicef UK - suggested up to 50% of the trafficking victims they offer help to are either pregnant or already have children. But the report said a national system to identify and support victims does not include questions on pregnancy. It found there was \"a post-code lottery\" of service. Ms Brotherton said having children or being pregnant adds \"an extra layer of vulnerability\" for victims. \"This group has special needs on top of dealing with their often traumatic trafficking experience and requires special support. \"Good practice exists in places but that's more down to experienced professionals who have developed it, but whose efforts are often undermined by the lack of systematic holistic response,\" she added.

{"text":"After Tuesday's play-off defeat at Luton, she said she would not go into partnership with Wrexham Supporters' Trust (WST) to buy the club. Her spokesman said she had received death threats, not reported to police, after becoming involved with Wrexham. Mrs Booth's withdrawal comes on the same day a winding-up order against the club was dismissed. The order, brought by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, was dismissed at a short hearing at the High Court in London after Wrexham paid off its \u00a3200,000 tax bill last month. This was done through a combination of donations and loans, but despite this, ownership of the club still needs to be resolved. Mrs Booth, who runs hotels and other businesses in the Llangollen, Wrexham and Mold areas, has been linked with the takeover for several months. The club first announced it was looking for a buyer in January when owner Geoff Moss and chairman Ian Roberts said they were stepping down from the board. Several bidders have said they are interested. Former footballer Ashley Ward, who started his career at the club, said he had held preliminary talks while businessman Stephen Cleeve outlined his interest on the Red Passion website. But since Mrs Booth and the trust announced they would work together they have been seen to be favourites. Last month the club survived a \u00a3200,000 tax demand when the money was paid off thanks to a combination of donations and loans. It cleared the way for the team to take part in the end-of-season promotion play-offs but Tuesday's defeat to Luton dashed hopes of a return to the Football League. After the defeat Mrs Booth said she was withdrawing from attempts to buy the club. She told BBC Radio Wales when she first launched her solo bid for the club the financing was in place. She said she was then asked to form a joint bid with the trust. \"I've urged them to meet and discuss the detail. They have declined and they've been meeting with two property developers. \"Why would two out-of-town property developers with no links to Wrexham want to buy a loss-making football club? She said her bid involved moving the football club and its assets - including the Racecourse and Colliers Park - into community ownership. \"It's never ever, ever going to make money as a football club or as a joint football and rugby club. \"[The Racecourse is] an important asset and it should be used for more than 3,000 people. \"It should be used by the population of Wrexham town.\" Spencer Harris, board member of WST, said: \"As a board of supporters, we've seen some of the statements made in the press by Stephanie Booth this morning and I have to say we're really disappointed that Stephanie would conduct herself in this way. \"I guess the key things are the board of the Wrexham Supporters Trust only ever received an outline proposal from Stephanie. \"That proposal lacked any detail and a formal proposal of what she was actually suggesting or putting to us never in fact materialised.\" He said WST was \"willing to talk to anybody who's got the interest of Wrexham Football Club at heart\" and would hold a public meeting on Tuesday at the William Aston Hall to make its position clear.

It was first established in 1988 by two United Nations organizations, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and later endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly through Resolution 43\/53. Membership of the IPCC is open to all members of the WMO and UNEP. The purpose of the IPCC is to provide scientific information to policymakers on climate change, its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts, and options for adaptation and mitigation. The IPCC assesses the latest research on climate change and publishes reports that synthesize the findings for policymakers in a clear and accessible manner. Their reports provide an authoritative assessment of the state of knowledge on climate change, covering topics such as sea-level rise, ocean acidification, and the impacts on human health, ecosystems, and food security.\n\nThe IPCC operates on a cycle of assessment and review, with a new assessment cycle beginning every 5-7 years. During the assessment cycle, the IPCC produces three types of reports: the Assessment Report, which is the main product and is composed of several volumes; the Special Report, which addresses specific topics; and the Methodology Report, which provides guidance on how to carry out specific aspects of the assessment.\n\nThe success of the IPCC lies in its ability to bring together scientists and policymakers from around the world to examine and evaluate the latest scientific research on climate change. Its reports have come to form the basis for international climate policy negotiations, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. As global concern over climate change continues to grow, the role of the IPCC in providing scientifically rigorous information for decision-makers has become increasingly important.","prompt_len":496.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":2046}

This renewal of hostilities in the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict released the underlying economic pressure on oil prices.

An n, m, or k index is therefore written as 2m + 2n+4. For most big-O notation, higher and lower bounds are expressed as a decimal point followed by a positive, exponentiated power of n. To compute a lower bound, one does 2n2 - 2n \u2013 4, which is a sum of squares with n as the square root.

After the murders within her fantasies are committed, Lorna awakens bewildered, often clueless as to if what she was privy to within her dreams ever took place in reality.<br \/><br \/>If someone asked me how to describe this particular work from Franco, I'd say it's elegant & difficult. By now, you've probably read other user comments befuddled by what this film is about, since a large portion of it takes place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream. Franco mentioned in an interview that he was heavily influenced by Godard early in his career, as far as film-making style, and so deciding to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of trying to create a whole different type of viewing experience. And, as you read from the reaction of the user comments here..some like this decision, others find the style labouring, dull, and bewildering. I'll be the first to admit that the film is over my head, but even Franco himself, when quizzed by critics who watched \"\"Succubus\"\", admitted that he didn't even understand the film and he directed it! Some might say that \"\"Succubus\"\" was merely a precursor to his more admired work, \"\"Venus in Furs\"\", considered his masterwork by Franco-faithful, because it also adopts the surreal, dreamlike structure where the protagonist doesn't truly know whether he\/she is experiencing something real or imagined. In a sense, like the protagonist, we are experiencing the same type of confusion..certainly, \"\"Succubus\"\" is unconventional film-making where we aren't given the keys to what is exactly going on. And, a great deal of the elusive dialogue doesn't help matters. \"\"Succubus\"\" is also populated by beatnik types and \"\"poet-speak\"\", Corman's film, \"\"A Bucket of Blood\"\" poked fun at.

National Grid owns and operates key parts of Britain's energy infrastructure. It charges generators regulated prices to transport electricity across its power network. But it also balances supply and demand across the network. It's this system operator function that critics say should be separated out of the overall group.

Attention has focused upon National Grid's role in developing interconnector cables to import power from abroad. Critics say that, as the system operator, National Grid could prioritise sourcing electricity via these cables rather than from other sources of generation. Pointing to the situation in the United States, the then chairman of the committee, Angus MacNeil, stated that: \"The Independent System Operator model has worked in the USA. It is time for it to be brought to these shores.\" But National Grid's chief executive, John Pettigrew, had argued against a break-up, saying that he was not convinced that creating a separate system operator would be beneficial to customers.

These bosons and jets are produced in abundance in the high-energy collisions, and serve as a complicating factor in experiments designed to detect and measure other, more elusive particles and phenomena. In order to accurately analyze the data, physicists need to be able to distinguish between these background events and the ones they are actually interested in. One way to do this is to use advanced computational techniques and machine learning algorithms to sort through the copious amounts of data generated by the collider experiments. By carefully filtering and categorizing the events, scientists can gain a clearer picture of the underlying physics at the heart of the universe. Ultimately, by studying the production of @xmath0 bosons in association with jets, researchers hope to uncover new insights into the fundamental nature of matter, energy, and the forces that govern them.","prompt_len":112.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1006}

{"text":"It is likely that a multicomponent, adaptive immune system arose with the first vertebrates, as invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody-based humoral response. Many species, however, utilize mechanisms that appear to be precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity. Immune systems appear even in the structurally most simple forms of life, with bacteria using a unique defense mechanism, called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens, called bacteriophages. This system involves modifying the DNA of the bacteria, making it resistant to specific viruses. In turn, viruses have evolved ways to evade this defense mechanism, driving the co-evolution of both viruses and bacteria. Other invertebrates, such as insects, utilize non-cellular components of the immune system, such as antimicrobial peptides, phagocytosis, and melanization, to combat infections. These mechanisms are not as specific as those found in the adaptive immune system of vertebrates, but they are effective in protecting the organism from a wide range of pathogens.\n\nAs vertebrates evolved, their immune systems became more complex, with the development of T and B lymphocytes and the ability to generate a diverse array of antibodies. This allows for the recognition and targeted destruction of specific pathogens, as well as the ability to remember previous infections and mount a faster response upon subsequent exposure. The vertebrate immune system also includes non-specific mechanisms, such as innate immunity, which provides a rapid response to pathogens before the adaptive immune system can mount a specific response.\n\nOverall, the evolution of immune systems has been shaped by the ongoing arms race between hosts and pathogens. As pathogens evolve to evade host defenses, hosts evolve new mechanisms to combat infections, creating a complex and highly adaptable immune system.","prompt_len":520.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1921}

Rats in group 2 received an intracisternal injection of saline, while rats in group 3 were given an injection of capsaicin. Following these treatments, the rats were sacrificed and their frontal cortex and meningeal vessels were examined for changes in immunoreactivities for NOS enzymes.\n\nThe results showed that capsaicin significantly increased the immunoreactivities of NOS enzymes in both the frontal cortex and meningeal vessels, compared to the saline group. However, pre-treatment with sumatriptan significantly attenuated these increases in immunoreactivities.\n\nOverall, these findings suggest that chemical stimulation of the subarachnoid space can induce changes in the expression of NOS enzymes in the brain and vasculature.

{"text":"we discuss techniques for accelerating the self consistent field ( scf ) iteration for solving the kohn - sham equations . these techniques are all based on constructing approximations to the inverse of the jacobian associated with a fixed point map satisfied by the total potential . they can be viewed as preconditioners for a fixed point iteration . The inverse jacobian approximations reduce the condition number of the fixed point map and effectively improve the convergence of the scf iterations. One common approach is to use density mixing, where the density from the previous iteration is combined with the one from the current iteration to generate a new density to be used in the next iteration. This helps improve the initial guess for the next potential, which in turn results in faster convergence of the scf iterations.\n\nAnother technique is to use direct inversion in the iterative subspace (DIIS). DIIS uses a linear combination of previous potentials and densities to construct an improved guess for the next potential. This method has proven to be particularly effective in systems with slow-converging scf iterations.\n\nFinally, the Pulay method is another popular approach for accelerating scf iterations. This method constructs a linear combination of previous potentials to obtain an improved guess for the next potential. The coefficients of the linear combination are obtained by minimizing the residual error. The Pulay method has the advantage of being able to rapidly speed up the convergence of scf iterations for larger systems.\n\nOverall, the use of these techniques can greatly enhance the efficiency of scf iterations for solving the Kohn-Sham equations. By constructing appropriate approximations to the inverse of the Jacobian, these methods effectively improve the initial guess for the potential, leading to faster convergence of the scf iterations and a more rapid solution of the Kohn-Sham equations.","prompt_len":352.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1937}

{"text":"Someone claiming to be a construction worker gave an off-duty police officer the knife some years ago and he kept it, thinking the case was closed. Police recently recovered the knife and are testing it for DNA and hair samples. Simpson had been accused of killing his ex-wife and her friend in June of 1994. But a jury found the former American football star not guilty after a dramatic televised trial. Police cast some doubt on whether the knife was connected to the OJ Simpson case at a news conference on Friday, saying it could be \"bogus\". \"If this story is accurate, you'd think anytime you come into contact with evidence that you should submit it to investigators,\" said Captain Andrew Neiman of the LAPD. \"I don't know why that didn't happen.\" Citing police sources, NBC News reported that the knife was a utility-type knife and was not consistent with the one used in the crime. Simpson, who is currently serving a 33-year sentence for armed robbery and kidnapping in Las Vegas, cannot be prosecuted again under US law for the murders. Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown and her friend Ronald Goldman were found stabbed in the head and neck in the yard of Brown's home. Authorities asked Simpson to turn himself in after the murders, but he failed show up at the police station. He was spotted inside a White Ford Bronco hours later, leading to a slow-speed pursuit across Los Angeles' motorways. The pursuit was broadcast on live television to millions of viewers. Analysis, James Cook, Los Angeles correspondent For many it was the trial of the century. As OJ Simpson learned his fate in 1995 it felt like the whole world was watching. The superstar's acquittal divided the United States, in part at least on racial lines. At first Simpson had fled, pursued by police and paparazzi on live television, his supporters waving cardboard placards as they cheered him on. The question now is whether modern DNA techniques can prove whether or not their loyalty to the man they called \"The Juice\" was misplaced. Of course the knife may turn out to have nothing to do with the murders, and in any case, the law of double jeopardy protects Simpson from a retrial. He is in prison anyway. Since 2008 Simpson has been serving a 33-year sentence for armed robbery and kidnapping in Las Vegas. But he can apply for parole from next year, a moment which will surely reignite the controversy. When it comes to OJ, the fascination, the division and the heartbreak never seem to end. He eventually surrendered after 90 minutes in which crowds gathered to watch along the road and news helicopters flew overhead. He later assembled a \"dream team\" of highly paid lawyers for the case, including Johnnie Cochran and Robert Kardashian. The trial, which lasted for 10 months, created a huge media frenzy. Television networks reaped high ratings from airing trial proceedings and many magazine covers were devoted to it. Simpson later lost a wrongful death lawsuit brought by the victims' families. His property, where the knife was found, was razed in 1998. The case recently returned to prominence with the airing of the TV miniseries American Crime Story: The People v OJ Simpson.

With Great Britain having claimed the entire Australian continent east of the 135th meridian east in 1788, Victoria was included in the wider colony of New South Wales. The first settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay, and much of what is now Victoria was included in the Port Phillip District in 1836, an administrative division of New South Wales. However, as the population in the Port Phillip District grew, there were increasing calls for separation from New South Wales. In 1851, the colony of Victoria was officially established, becoming the second self-governing colony in Australia after New South Wales. This was followed by a gold rush in the same year, leading to a rapid influx of immigrants and a dramatic population increase. Melbourne, which had been founded as a small pastoral settlement in 1835, became one of the largest and wealthiest cities in the world by the late 19th century. Victoria continued to prosper throughout the 20th century, with significant development in industry, infrastructure, and cultural institutions.

{"text":"BBC Indonesian's Christine Franciska looks at why this extraordinary visit has got Indonesians talking. The Indonesia visit is part of a month-long Asia tour for the king, that includes Malaysia, Brunei, Japan, China and the Maldives. After attending bilateral meeting in Jakarta, King Salman flew to Bali on Saturday, on six Boeing planes and one Hercules. He took along a 1,500-strong entourage - including 25 princes - and hundreds of tonnes of equipment and luxury goods. When the king disembarked the plane - via his own gold-coloured escalator - there were at least 2,500 Indonesian police and military personnel ready for him to guard the island. He is staying at a luxury resort a few steps from the beach at Nusa Dua. Question were being asked about whether the beach would be closed during his visit, as happened on a public beach in southern France two years ago. But instead, reports say the hotel's management built special walkways and erected bamboo fencing covered in white fabric to provide privacy. Whenever Muslim leaders from conservative countries go on visits, there is one thing that often sparks a debate: do you need to cover naked statues to respect the guests? Last year a Rome museum covered up classical nude sculptures in temporary wooden cartons during a visit by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. In Indonesia, the answer is yes, and no. Some naked statues in Bogor Palace, where the king met President Joko Widodo, were covered with cloth, as a sign of respect for the Muslim monarch. But officials in Bali - a majority Hindu island in the majority Muslim country - said they would not cover up the ubiquitous statues of deities and semi-naked women. \"We're just going to leave [the statues] as they are, we don't have to cover up anything because it is our culture,\" Bali local government spokesman Dewa Mahendra told AFP, adding that the statues \"are cultural creations\" and art. He may have had his privacy, but local police did arrest two women who tried to breach security to meet King Salman. One of them, a 41-year-old woman, tried to enter the St Regis Hotel to give the king 500-pages of poetry, local police told BBC Indonesian. \"This is not a big threat,\" said Bali Police chief Insp Gen Petrus R. Golose. \"It might be because there are a lot of media coverage, so people want to come here and see King Salman.\" Mr Golose said the two intruders had been sent for psychiatric evaluations. While fans may have no luck getting near the king, they could certainly stalk some of princes on Instagram, to see what they have been doing. Prince Faisal bin Khalid bin Sultan and Prince Abdulrahman bin Badr are active on social media, Antara news agency reports. But Prince Fahad bin Faisal Al Saud has been the one receiving a lot of the attention. He's not believed to be part of the entourage, but has visited Bali before and has a regularly updated and varied Instagram account.

{"text":"mass transfer in close binaries is often non - conservative and the modeling of this kind of mass transfer is mathematically challenging as in this case due to the loss of mass as well as angular momentum the governing system gets complicated and uncertain . in the present work a new mathematical model has been prescribed for the non - conservative mass transfer in a close binary system taking in to account the gradually decreasing profile of the mass accretion rate by the gainer star with respect to time as well as with respect to the increase in mass of the gainer star . the process of mass transfer is understood to occur up to a critical mass limit of the gainer star beyond which this process may cease to work under the consideration that the gainer is spun up through an accretion disk . The proposed model takes into account various factors like the eccentricity of the binary orbit, the temperature gradient of the gainer star, and the energy loss through radiation. The model predicts a gradual decrease in mass transfer rate as the gainer star accretes more mass. This is in contrast to the traditional model which assumes a constant mass transfer rate.\n\nThe gradual decrease in mass transfer rate is attributed to the decrease in the gainer star's surface area as it accretes more mass, leading to a decrease in the Roche lobe radius. The model also shows that the critical mass limit of the gainer star depends on the initial mass ratio and eccentricity of the binary system.\n\nThe model is tested using numerical simulations and is found to accurately predict the evolution of the binary system over time. The results suggest that the non-conservative mass transfer in close binary systems is more complex than previously thought.\n\nOverall, the proposed mathematical model provides a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the non-conservative mass transfer in close binary systems. The model can be used to study the evolution of various types of binary systems, including cataclysmic variables, X-ray binaries, and symbiotic stars.","prompt_len":801.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":2063}

{"text":"The dominant explanation for the Black Death is the plague theory, which attributes the outbreak to Yersinia pestis, also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern China in 1865, eventually spreading to India. The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin, after whom the pathogen was named Yersinia pestis. The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul-Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. Once flea populations became large, often thousands to millions, they released significant numbers of airborne organisms into which human hosts breathed, resulting in the disease\u2019s epidemic distribution. The Black...\nThe Black Death Essay\n...The Black Death was one of the scariest times in history and the beginning of the end of the 100-Years War. It was a devastating disease that killed a third of Europe within a few short years. The first sign of the disease was a bloody cough followed by a high fever. Then people started to shrivel up and eventually died. What they found was that the plague was caused by a bacterial. They called the disease Bubonic plague, because of the appearance of the boils under the skin and the swelling of the lymphatic glands called buboes. The buboes are located on the large muscles in the neck and armpits. The buboes get so nasty and disgusting that women would throw themselves off ledges. In 1347, the first sign of the plague was seen in the black market area of England. There were many poor people who lived off the government and did a lot of begging for money and food.

This would bring the ships to full operational (Version Five) status. When the first Visby corvettes were delivered in version five in 2012, there were trained crews available. In 2012 FMV delivered two corvettes of Visby class to the Swedish Armed Forces. This meant that there were two Visby corvettes which can hunt submarines with torpedoes, depth charges and sonar. They can both deploy and clear mines, and fire anti-ship missiles. They also have an airport function for takeoff and landing helicopters. The ships have been supplemented by including mine clearance systems, helicopter landing capability, anti-surface ship missile and additional stealth adaption.

Now pour into the tin and level out!You can halve some strawberries and place them on top to decorate, if you like.The cheesecake now needs to go in the fridge to set for a good few hours, or overnight even.When it has firmed up nicely, make the strawberry sauce. It's very simple, just blend up the stalkless strawberries with a little stevia and some lemon juice.

With more buyers on the market, and interest rates near record lows, house prices should increase.Edwards referred to recent comments by Marc Faber, publisher of the Gloom, Boom & Doom Report, who said the Fed's decision to maintain its $85-billion-per-month quantitative easing program meant it was \"climbing to a higher diving board.\"(Read more: Albert Edwards: Bernanke, Osborne blowing bubbles )But Edwards added: \"I go further.

{"text":"It is hardly a place you would associate with acid attack victims. But for more than a decade Musarat Misbah's salon has been a refuge for women who've been attacked by acid. It started when a woman came to Musarat's salon with her face covered. \"When she removed her veil, I had to sit down. There was no life in my legs,\" Musarat said. \"In front of me was a woman with no face. Her eyes and nose were gone and her neck and face were stuck together so she couldn't move them.\" The woman hoped that Musarat, a veteran of the beauty business, would help her look better. Musarat called doctors and asked them to help the woman - and thus began her charity work for acid attack victims. In the last 10 years, Musarat has helped hundreds of acid attack victims. With donations, she pays for their medical treatment and then trains them for the workplace. Some now work at her salon. Bushra Shafi is one of the most experienced beauticians. She is also an acid attack survivor. Bushra was attacked by her in-laws as punishment for not paying enough dowry money. \"My husband, brother-in-law and father-in-law poured acid on me - my mother-in-law tied me down from the neck. They didn't take me to the hospital for 10 days and my face swelled so much it was just a big slab of meat,\" Bushra said. Bushra went to Musarat for help. Her eyes were burned shut, her nose was gone and parts of her ears had melted. She spent years undergoing operations and now, after 150 of them, she has a chance to start a new life. \"I'm grateful,\" she says. \"I've got my eyesight back, my hearing back, I have a nose I can breathe from, a tongue, I can speak again.\" The scars on her face cannot hide her smile as she speaks. Musarat's charity is one of very few organisations in Pakistan that have taken on this cause. She says the government needs to do much more to help these women. \"Because it is a female-orientated issue, it comes right at the bottom of their [the government's] priority list. Also, they say it tarnishes the image of our country. This is why it is hushed up and swept under the carpet.\" There have been at least 160 acid attacks recorded this year alone but charities say the real number is likely to be much higher. Many victims keep quiet because they are afraid they will be attacked again. And even when some cases are reported and make it to court, the perpetrators rarely face justice. Full coverage: 100 Women \"Because of the social stigma to this there's so much pressure on the victims and their families,\" Saad Rasool, a lawyer working on a new law to criminalise acid attacks, says. \"Many families settle outside court and no one gets convicted,\" he adds. Huma Shahid was attacked in January. She was a lecturer and on her way back from university. Someone threw acid on her just outside her house and escaped on a motorbike. \"It was 10 days before my wedding,\" she said. \"I was about to marry the man who adored me, but all of a sudden my life changed.\" Huma spent months in hospital and says she still needs more operations. Her face is still covered with a protective mask, which she hides with a headscarf. She says the man who poured acid on her is still at large. Huma says she hasn't been able to look at her face in the mirror since the attack. \"It is so painful - whenever I reflect - I'm overwhelmed by the sheer brutality of the crime. People call me a strong woman. But I'm not that strong to see myself like this,\" she said. Huma adds she never expected this would happen to her. She thought acid attacks were a problem for people from poorer areas who were less well-educated. \"I think it's not about being educated or not. It's a mindset. People believe that these attacks on women are somehow justified. You notice that the majority of cases are women. They are considered a weaker gender,\" she said. Huma has taken her case to court. She says that despite everything, she wants to get on with her life and her work - but it is not always easy. \"It's very frustrating at times to realise that the person who actually did this to me has not been caught yet. Sometimes I feel helpless.\" Despite the fact she still faces a number of operations Huma says she hopes one day she'll be able to look in the mirror again.

The use of polarization qubits in our system ensures a high level of security in the transmission of information. Any eavesdropping on the communication channel would result in a change in the polarization state of the qubits, which could be easily detected by the receiver. Additionally, by encoding the qubits into faint laser pulses, we reduce the likelihood of detection by a potential eavesdropper.\n\nTo further improve the reliability of our system, we have incorporated classical framing information into the communication channel. This information is sent via sequences of strong laser pulses that precede the quantum data. The framing information allows for synchronization of the sender and receiver, as well as identification of each party involved in the communication. It also compensates for time-varying birefringence in the communication channel, which can cause fluctuations in the polarization state of the qubits. By adjusting the frame timing based on this information, we can ensure that the qubits are received accurately with minimal errors.\n\nOverall, our fibre-based quantum key distribution system provides a high level of security and reliability for the transmission of sensitive information.

{"text":"The success of any pathogen depends on its ability to elude host immune responses. Therefore, pathogens evolved several methods that allow them to successfully infect a host, while evading detection or destruction by the immune system. Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier, for example, by using a type II secretion system. In addition, many bacteria and viruses have developed mechanisms to modulate host immune responses. One such method is the production of molecules that mimic host proteins, allowing the pathogen to avoid detection by the immune system. Another strategy is to suppress or inhibit the host immune response, for example, by producing proteins that interfere with the signaling pathways involved in host immunity.\n\nSome pathogens are also able to change their surface molecules, making it difficult for the immune system to recognize and respond to them. This process, known as antigenic variation, allows the pathogen to continue infecting the host while evading immune surveillance.\n\nOverall, the success of a pathogen in causing disease depends on a complex interplay between the pathogen and the host immune system. By understanding the strategies employed by pathogens to elude immune detection, scientists can develop more effective treatments and vaccines to combat these diseases.","prompt_len":373.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1358}

{"text":"You will see an amazing supermoon up in the night sky, which means the moon will be very big and bright. There was a supermoon last month but this one is particularly special. That's because it will be the biggest and brightest that it has been since 1948 - that's almost 70 years! But what actually is a supermoon anyway? Two things have to happen for there to be a supermoon. Firstly, it must be a full moon. Secondly, the moon must be at a point during its orbit where it is particularly close to Earth. The moon orbits the Earth in an oval shape, and sometimes it is closer to the Earth than at other times. When the moon is at the stage when it is closest to Earth, this is called its perigee. When it is further away, this is the moon's apogee. The reason that the supermoon this month is particularly special is because the moon will be even closer to Earth than it has been for decades, so it will be bigger and brighter than you will ever have seen in your entire life! Usually, a supermoon is about 14% bigger and 30% brighter than a full moon when it is further away from the Earth. Go out at night and have a look at the sky on the night of 13 or 14 November. Try to go somewhere where there aren't many other lights, as this can distract from how bright the moon is and how easily you can see it. If you look at it when the moon is nearer to the horizon, this can create an optical illusion which will make it look even bigger and more spectacular. There is due to be another supermoon on 14 December, but it won't be as amazing as the November one, which is the biggest so far this century. The December supermoon will be special for its own reason. Because it is so bright, it will make seeing the Geminid meteor shower next month much more difficult than usual. As for November's supermoon, you won't see one as impressive as this again until the end of November in 2034, so it's well worth making sure you step outside to take a look!

{"text":"Instead of having to use a series of passwords and numbers, users will be able to log on to their accounts by placing one of their fingers into a scanner. The technology is quite distinct from fingerprint recognition. To begin with, Barclays will offer the service to business customers only. However, \"finger vein authentication\", as it is known, is likely to be offered to all customers in the future. A portable scanner, the size of a tennis ball, is plugged into the computer's USB port and uses near-infra-red light to check the unique pattern of veins inside the finger. Only a living finger is accepted by the scanner, reducing the risk that fraudsters will use substitutes or copies to break into a bank account. Banks are casting around for new ways to combat fraud, as users become increasingly fed up with multiple passwords and PINs, or having to use electronic number generators whenever they log on. The new finger vein technique has been pioneered by the Japanese firm Hitachi. It is already installed in cash machines in Japan and Poland, allowing people to withdraw money without using a card or PIN. Any business adopting the technology can register several fingers from different members of staff, so one person can make a payment and another can approve it. The unit can be plugged into different computers. When an attempt is made to log on to the account, the user is invited to \"place a finger lightly on the scanner\", and is then told \"a finger is detected\". If approved, access is allowed within seconds. Barclays says the technology is relatively expensive at the moment. It will charge business customers for the convenience of having the machines, although it will not reveal the level of fees. \"For corporate clients who do a lot of large transactions, this makes a lot of sense,\" explained Ashok Vaswani, the bank's head of personal and corporate banking. He cautions that the scanner is not yet ready for the popular market, where customers are averse to paying extra. In any case, most ordinary customers prefer to use smartphones to manage their accounts. \"Obviously you can't use such a clunky tool along with mobile banking,\" said Mr Vaswani. \"I don't think this exact machine is going to be used for retail, but some version of this will definitely come for retail.\" Vein recognition is thought to be a more secure technology than checking finger prints, partly because of the requirement for the finger to be \"live\". That should also eliminate the grim possibility of a criminal hacking off someone's finger in an attempt to use it to remove funds from an account. Light transmitted through the finger is partially absorbed by haemoglobin passing through the veins, enabling the unit to authenticate the user's vein pattern. Hitachi, which has been researching the technology for 15 years, said vein patterns are established in the womb and remain stable for most of a person's life. But there is some concern that people's biometric information, including vein patterns, might be used or exploited by fraudsters or even government agencies. Barclays emphasises that the finger details of its customers will be safe. It will not store their details centrally and there will be no public record. Once the system is up and running next year, the information will be held on a computer chip inside the scanner in encrypted form. And if engineers can make the scanners smaller and more cheaply, people could start \"finger banking\" in homes across the UK. ","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":3488}

Bone marrow transplantation involves replacing the patient's damaged bone marrow with healthy bone marrow from a donor.\n\nThe side effects of ALL treatment can be difficult to manage and may include fatigue, nausea, hair loss, and increased risk of infections. Children may also experience long-term effects such as fertility issues, heart and lung problems, and a higher risk of developing another type of cancer in the future.\n\nDespite the challenges, the high survival rate for childhood ALL is a testament to the effectiveness of modern cancer treatments. Ongoing research is focused on finding even better treatments that can improve outcomes and reduce the side effects of ALL treatment. The hope is that someday childhood ALL will be a curable disease for every child.","prompt_len":64.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1570}

Gabrielsson visited the Californian company Glasspar to talk about a new sports car. Glasspar was a company which made glass-fibre bodies for boats and cars, like the Chevrolet Corvette (the most popular car of the USA which has a glass-fibre body). Gabrielsson told Glasspar to develop a new sports car on a PV444-chassis, running gear and the new B14B 70bhp engine. The design drawings (Gabrielsson thought Volvo needed a sports car to boost up the sales of the PV) were actually completed before Gabriellson left the USA.Bill Tritt (Glasspar) working on a clay scale model of the car that would become the Volvo P1900At the end of 1953 Glasspar finished two protoypes (designed by Bill Tritt): a convertible and a coup\u00e9. The car was called: Volvo P1900, also known as Volvo Sport. The coup\u00e9 had a heavy front with a big grille (which looked like the Ferrari Mille Miglia) but the upper part of the car didn't really match with the rest of the car. The open car was a better design: the nose was better, less rounded windscreens and nicer details. Volvo decided to let Glasspar build three prototypes which should be transported to Sweden for testdrives. The plan was to build 300 cars per year and was only available for the export market.One of the two first Volvo prototypes made by Glasspar. This is the coup\u00e9-versionWhen the test driving was finished, production started in 1956. The P1900 had some modifications: the windscreen was slightly more curved, the car had retractable side windows and was also equipped with a fold-down top. In March 1956 Helmer Petterson and Pelle Nystrom took a P1900 for a testdrive to North-Africa (via Southern Europe, a roadtrip of 16.000km). Unfortunately the car had more troubles and problems than they expected: the chassis was too flexible and weak, the doors didn't open and close well (due bad door mountings) and at some parts (especially at the body mountings with the chassis) the glass-fibre started to runout. When Petterson told Engellau (who replaced Gabrielsson as Vice President) the production of the P1900 stopped. There were only 70 P1900's build (3 prototypes and 67 production models).The final version of the Volvo P1900 (also known as Volvo Sport)History of the Volvo P1800Helmer Petterson couldn't get the idea of a sportscar out of his head. He convinced the management Volvo really should develop a car which was perfect for the export-market. In the meanwhile his son Pelle was graduated at his design-studies in the USA and moved to Italy to work for Frua in 1957. Volvo agreed to develop a car at a Italian chassisbuilder because the idea a Italian designed car should boost the sales of the car a little.

The presence of caa can pose several challenges during the procedure, including difficulties with guidewire crossing, balloon dilation, and stent delivery. The aneurysmal segment may also predispose to thrombus formation, which can lead to distal embolization and myocardial infarction. In addition, the use of standard sized stents in the aneurysmal segment can result in incomplete coverage and increased risk of stent thrombosis. To address these concerns, several strategies have been proposed, including the use of specialized devices such as covered stents or bioabsorbable scaffolds, as well as the incorporation of imaging modalities such as intravascular ultrasound or optical coherence tomography to guide stent selection and placement. However, the decision to intervene in lesions with caa should always be carefully weighed against the potential risks and benefits, with consideration given to patient-specific factors such as comorbidities and extent of coronary artery disease.","prompt_len":112.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1105}
{"text":"The evolutionary strategy used by cicadas of the genus Magicicada make use of prime numbers. These insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground.

This is a strategy which is shared with some other species such as the mayflies and the fireflies, that uses also the prime numbers, but their interval of expression is shorter. This strategy, by contrast, has no biological advantage: there is actually less of a disadvantage of emerging less frequently than other species who emerge just once in their lives. The evolutionary strategy used by the cicada is only a consequence of the fact that we live in a society where people use computers with an average of 4 and 10 digits in the numbers they use.

This makes the potential difference between the ions in the oxide and the insulator the same throughout.

The study of the Higgs boson pair production, therefore, plays a crucial role in exploring the fundamental properties of the Higgs sector and understanding the dynamics of the electroweak symmetry breaking. Additionally, it has important implications for the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model, which could manifest itself through modifications of the Higgs boson couplings.

{"text":"Amiibo ShortageWired wrote an interesting article a while back about an amiibo bubble. The article cites a few reasons for why they believe this is the case: retailers having to carry too much stock, replacing amiibo with new lines (or waves), and the perspective from consumers that the newest amiibo will be gone. What this has done is lured in resellers trying to make a quick buck by buying up the already limited stock and reselling them on Ebay for an exorbitant mark-up. As I write this, Rosalina amiibo are selling for 40 dollars on Ebay. So, I want to explore this issue a bit more using some economic theories, the events that led to the burst of the Beanie Baby bubble, and how Nintendo can address this issue before it kills the goose that laid the golden egg.Amiibo Success StoryNintendo has reported that consumers have purchased 3.5 million amiibo figures in a few short weeks. Furthermore, the attach rate is nearly two figures per copy of Super Smash Bros for Wii U. It's clear the initial response to amiibo has been warm. Nintendo president, Satoru Iwata, has discussed his plans to expand Nintendo's business, on top of development. In describing his plan, he stated \"we intend to simultaneously challenge ourselves with new endeavors which include our plan to take advantage of smart devices, more aggressive use of Nintendo's character IP and our new QOL improvement platform business.\" amiibo seems to be but one way for Nintendo to expand their IPs. With Nintendo promoting toys of Nintendo characters, it's no surprise they decided to launch amiibo with the Super Smash Bros. series. This is one of the first times fans can get toys of Nintendo characters, from famous characters like Mario and Pikachu to more obscure ones like Captain Falcon and Marth.ShortageI'm sure you are all aware of Supply and Demand, the most recognizable theory of Economics. Essentially, the price we are willing to pay is both a function of demand (how much we want) and supply (how much is available). The price for a good or service will be where supply and demand meet, which we call equilibrium. This is all well and good, in theory. Sometimes, it doesn't always work out like that. What if how much we want, given a certain price, is more that what the market has to offer. That's when we have a shortage. Think of a hurricane; everyone is trying to get supplies all at once. There is a lot of demand for extra food, water, and other essentials. But since the current supply can not handle the demand of consumers, we have a shortage.And that is what is going on with the amiibo right now. We want more than what the market has available. However, this has also caused the price of amiibo on the secondary market to skyrocket. The exorberant prices are the market's way to have demand match supply. With price increasing to $40, the quantity demanded falls and supply and demand reaches equilibrium.So what caused the shortage in the first place?","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":2956}

Star Trek is about our future, not one in a galaxy far, far away, but right here on Earth with our history and values.To watch Star Trek is to wonder not only what might be possible one day, but also what we can do now to get closer to a Federation-like future. With more than 40 years of television and film carefully considered, Trek fans understand the hard work and difficult questions we must face if we are ever to make real life as prosperous as the 23rd and 24th Centuries.One such question is that of security, particularly our comfort level with security measures that may impact our other values, such as privacy or human rights. Today, we are wrestling with this balance in America and around the world. It has been at the heart of recent debates over things like the controversial NSA Prism program, which detractors equate to limitless wire-tapping of citizens, or the release of classified military information on sites like WikiLeaks.In the midst of these complex issues is perhaps the most visible national security case in recent memory, that of U.S. Army Soldier Chelsea Manning (born Bradley Manning), who, with the help of WikiLeaks, released the largest cache of classified information in U.S. history. Manning and supporters believe the breach in security was justified, having discovered a video showing the deaths of civilians in Iraq. Others strongly disagree, including the courts, which sentenced Manning last month to 35 years in prison for espionage.No matter one's opinion of Manning, the NSA or any such case, they shine a light on our current values around security and privacy. In the case of Manning, who saw these actions as honorable, we find ourselves torn between our modern notions of duty and loyalty and those of the thoughtful heroism we often celebrate on television, including in Star Trek. After all, it seems that the moments when our hero speaks out against a wrong make the best episodes.In Star Trek, it is rare for such an episode to conclude with a conviction or dishonorable discharge from Starfleet. More common are endings where the captain or officer, having disobeyed orders, is cleared of wrongdoing, if not given a promotion once his motivations are revealed as just.

{"text":"Causes and Effects of Emigration from Germany (1870s-1880s)Between Bismarck's appointment as minister president of Prussia in 1862 and his departure from office in 1890, almost 3 million Germans left their country in search of a better life abroad. Many of them went to the United States. These emigrants included land-hungry peasants and workers from rural backgrounds, as well as artisans and shopkeepers hoping to make a new start. Between 1874 and 1879 emigration decreased somewhat, but after 1880 economic fluctuations fuelled the next and largest wave of emigration, which only began to subside in the mid-1890s. This report by a British Royal Commission analyzes the causes and effects of German emigration. It highlights low wages, a lack of employment opportunities, and the decline of older industries as economic reasons for emigration, but political considerations \u2013 e.g., the attitude of the German government towards the Social Democratic movement \u2013 also played an important role. The attractiveness of the U.S. was enhanced when Germans contemplating emigration received upbeat letters or money transfers (remittances) from friends and relatives who were already there. Enticing advertisements by steamship companies only added to the allure. Like later advocates of German colonization, however, the authors of this report recognize that emigration also drained Germany of productive forces and potential military recruits. print version return to document list previous document next document page 1 of 2Some indications have already been given of the causes which are at work in this vast migratory movement of the German population. The difficulty of distinguishing between the various factors, social, political, and economic, which combine to produce such a result, can scarcely be overestimated; but the immense preponderance of natives of the agricultural districts amongst the emigrants point to the defective conditions of agriculture as the main source of the discontent with home surroundings, which must always precede any migration of population. Putting for a moment this important factor on one side, due weight must be allowed to the social and political causes which combine to produce the result. Amongst these may be enumerated the attitude of the German government prior to 1890 towards the great body of German Socialists, and the discontent felt, at any rate in time of peace, with the German military system. The desire for a fuller life, and for the advantages offered by the towns, have drawn a vast number of the best and most intelligent of the laboring classes from the east of Germany to the west. \"It is not so much the desire to obtain more money,\" says the last report of the East Prussian Association (Ostpreusslicher [sic] Centralverein), \"which impels, at any rate, the unmarried people to emigrate. [ . . . ] It is much more the wish for an independent life, and for pleasures and amusements which here, in the east, we cannot offer to the country folk.\" But, as Dr. Max Sering says, the cause lies even deeper, and must be sought in \"the ideals of freedom and human dignity,\" which have produced \"a striving after a higher social status,\" even independently of","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":3214}

{"text":"TWISTY CATS - THE ETHICS OF BREEDING FOR DEFORMITYThe originator of Twisty Cats says they are cute. Breeders worldwide have said she is cruel to deliberately breed deformed cats. Texan laws say she is doing nothing illegal. Who is right and what are the ethics of breeding for deformity? This site is a commentary on breeding ethics - I am not a breeder of Twisty cats.Important Note: It is necessary to understand that the European and American definition of \"abnormality, \"defect\" or \"deformity\"\" differs greatly. What American breeders see as a breed trait (short legs) many European countries condemn as a deformity. What is awarded high honours in the USA may be condemned in Europe.THE ORIGINS OF SELECTIVE BREEDINGThroughout the ages, humans have been fascinated by anything that is visibly different. This is well illustrated by the vast array of modern breeds of dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs etc many of which were bred for looks rather than function. Even before full domestication, undesirable traits could have been removed from an animal population by culling certain individuals, thus removing their genes from the gene pool. After domestication, selective breeding became easier. This possibly included selective breeding for colour and shape of horns (lyre-horned cattle) which may have been important traits for religious reasons.The concept of deliberately breeding for looks is chronicled as far back as biblical times when Jacob separated spotted animals from white animals. It no doubt goes back even to prehistoric times. Perhaps our ancestors found a wolf cub which looked different enough from other wolves that they kept it, and its tamest descendants, as novelties (later exploiting its traits as the domestic dog generations later). This must have happened again and again with horses, cattle, sheep, swine etc and it continues today. Colour and body type also makes it easier to distinguish between wild and domesticated animals - compare the looks of the primitive Przewalski horse and the selectively bred modern thoroughbred.Our inborn curiosity, coupled with our ability to control the breeding of animals, must be tempered with a respect for an animal's health and for the ongoing health of future generations of those we selective breed because they are visually pleasing or are useful to us. For example, white turkeys are bred for hypertrophied chest muscles to provide us with breast meat. However, the extreme over-development of the chest can make it impossible for the birds to mate naturally and they must be bred using artificial insemination. This would not occur in nature because animals which cannot mate cannot pass on their genes and the trait dies out except for occasional individuals which appear due to recessive genes or recombination of genes.THE REASONS FOR SELECTIVE BREEDINGMost breeders want to improve their breed. To want to improve a naturally evolved species perfected over many generations is part of human arrogance.

{"text":"For instance, could an \"unco-ordinated computer geek\" become a table-tennis star in one year? In an international experiment, a table-tennis coach gave an \"unsporty\" adult an hour's coaching every day for a year in a bid to make him one of the top table tennis players in Britain. Ben Larcombe, a young coach from north London, gave 24-year-old Sam Priestley more than 500 hours of personal tuition and took him to elite training centres in Hungary, Denmark and Middlesbrough. He predicted he could make Sam one of the 250 highest-ranked players in Britain within 12 months. That year has come to an end. \"I became interested in the idea that you can achieve mastery by the quantity and quality of your practice, not innate talent,\" says Ben. More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series and how to get in touch To test the theory, he needed someone without experience of table tennis or natural aptitude for the sport. Perhaps unflatteringly, he turned to his childhood friend Sam, a budding entrepreneur who describes himself as an \"unco-ordinated computer geek\". \"I was always one of the worst at any skill-based sport at school,\" says Sam. \"No one would call me sporty.\" In the book Bounce, former Commonwealth table tennis champion Matthew Syed supports the research of K Anders Ericsson which suggested that to become an expert in anything you need to put in an average of 10,000 hours of \"purposeful practice\". There are not 10,000 hours in a year, so Ben focused on the quality of Sam's training. \"If you go to a table tennis club you see lots of people who have played for many, many years, but they are just hitting balls mindlessly and playing matches,\" says Ben. \"Sam and I were always thinking about what we should do with the time we had. Everything we did was focused on Sam's improvement.\" Most lessons were held in the kitchen of Sam's shared flat on a table which also served as a dining table. Ben recorded every session and made a video compilation which shows one second of Sam playing on every day of the challenge. The result is a modern-day Rocky montage in which the streets of Philadelphia are replaced by a cramped flatshare in east London. The video shows Sam improving dramatically. After six months he was holding his own against seasoned club players. But he was still a long way from his target when the year ended. Rory Scott, a coach who has trained juniors who later played for England, watched Sam in a recent tournament. His verdict? \"He is nowhere near the standard of the top under-11 player in the UK.\" Why did the project fail? One reason might be that Ben chose the wrong sport. \"It is probably the most difficult sport to pick for this challenge,\" says Steve Brunskill, head coach at the Swerve Table Tennis Centre in Middlesbrough. \"Table tennis has the smallest court, the smallest ball, the smallest bat, the quickest reaction times, the most spin, and it's the only sport where you play on one surface but stand on another. \"You have to play so much to develop the skill, co-ordination and timing, and you have to learn to cope with different styles of opponent.\" Ben is still convinced the challenge is achievable. He thinks a lack of practice time was the main obstacle to Sam's success. \"The idea of showing people what the average Joe can achieve by squeezing in table tennis training after work was a lovely one, but to be successful someone would almost certainly need to do the challenge as a sort of gap year and play full time,\" Ben says. \"It's clear that talent matters and perhaps results would have been quicker with a more natural sportsman who has better movement and anticipation, possibly a tennis player. \"But I can still see no reason why anyone who works hard in a purposeful way cannot achieve their goal, in table tennis or any field.\" Matthew Syed is excited by Sam's progress. \"It debunks the idea that when you watch somebody who is good at something, they must have been blessed with a natural gift,\" he says. \"Most people have to train for a minimum of 10, sometimes 15 years, to reach mastery, but even by being committed for one year there has been a very big change in Sam's ability level and this is because the human brain is very adaptable.\" Mr Syed says this is an important lesson for anyone involved in education. \"In subjects like mathematics, if young people are not very good at the beginning they tend to give up because they don't think they have got a brain for numbers,\" he says. \"Whereas in places like China there is a very widespread cultural belief that you get better with training, so people tend to persist longer. \"The very belief about how success happens shapes the behaviours that we adopt.\" This is a view supported by OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] education expert, Andreas Schleicher, who has argued that attitudes to natural ability are key factors in test results. Mr Schleicher says in western countries failure to succeed in maths is frequently attributed by students to an innate lack of ability, arguing that success depends on being naturally gifted. In contrast, studies of top-performing Asian countries have shown pupils attribute their success or failure to their own efforts and the ability of their teachers. Jonathan Osborne, professor of science education at Stanford University in the US, agrees that changing students' attitudes is important. \"The problem is the motivation to practise, as any child who has learnt the violin or piano will tell you,\" he says. \"The real challenge is that practice is hard work, and the challenge for contemporary culture is that it is too dependent on immediate gratification.\" Michael Reiss, professor of science education at UCL Institute of Education, argues that dividing school pupils by ability encourages this idea of differences in talent rather than application. \"We should avoid putting students into sets according to attainment as much as possible and we should promote the message that effort matters,\" he says. As for Sam, he has not given up hope of reaching the top 250. His housemates should prepare to eat their dinner off a table tennis table for another year.

{"text":"this paper proposes a synthetic statistical top - down mimo power line communications channel model based on a pure phenomenological approach . The model is composed of two main parts: the channel impulse response and the frequency response. The channel impulse response describes the propagation of a signal through the power line channel, while the frequency response characterizes the channel behavior in different frequency ranges. In order to generate a realistic channel impulse response, the model uses a stochastic process based on the Saleh-Valenzuela (SV) channel model. This approach allows for variability in the channel response due to different locations of the transmitter and receiver along the power line. The frequency response is modeled by considering the effects of various physical phenomena such as attenuation, dispersion and noise. The proposed model is shown to accurately capture the behavior of real-world power line communication channels given its simplicity and flexibility. It is hoped that this model can be used as a tool for further research in power line communication systems, and aid in the development of more robust and efficient communication protocols.","prompt_len":143.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1194}

{"text":"The report, read by his defence lawyer, said he was mourning his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. On Monday, the court heard that he was not suffering from a mental disorder when he shot Ms Steenkamp. He denies murder, saying he killed her by mistake when fearing there was an intruder in the house. The prosecution says the Olympic athlete deliberately killed Ms Steenkamp, a model and law graduate, after the couple had an argument. Both prosecution and defence have accepted the findings of the psychologist's report. The BBC's Andrew Harding, who was in court, notes that both sides can interpret its findings favourably. Two reports - one by a psychologist and another by three psychiatrists - were drawn up after a month of tests to evaluate the athlete's state of mind. The prosecution on Monday noted that the psychiatrists' report said Mr Pistorius, 27, was capable of distinguishing between right and wrong and so should bear criminal responsibility for his actions. Another defence witness has described Oscar Pistorius as anxious and vulnerable. Professor Wayne Derman, who has known the athlete and treated him for six years testified about his \"exaggerated response\" when in uncomfortable situations - the \"fight or flight\" response. With the case coming to an end, two reports were pitted against each other, with each side quoting favourable excerpts. A report by a psychologist in the panel found that Mr Pistorius showed no signs of an explosive temper, narcissism or abusive behaviour, while a report by the three psychiatrists concluded that he could distinguish right from wrong. Both, however, agreed that he did not suffer from Generalised Anxiety Disorder, discrediting the testimony of a previous defence expert, which had led to the month-long, court-ordered evaluation. How is PTSD diagnosed? Defence lawyer Barry Roux on Wednesday quoted the second evaluation as saying that Mr Pistorius, a double-amputee, has a history of feeling insecure and vulnerable, especially without his prosthetic legs. It said he was likely to react more sharply to fear than an able-bodied person would. \"Should he not receive proper clinical care, his condition is likely to worsen and increase the risks for suicide,\" Mr Roux quoted the report as saying. It also said he did not show signs of narcissism or explosive rage, which is usually seen in men who are abusive to their partners. The court has previously heard that Ms Steenkamp had sent the athlete a message saying: \"I'm scared of you sometimes.\" Final defence witness Wayne Derman, professor of sports and exercise medicine at the University of Cape Town,  said Mr Pistorius was an anxious individual, with hand tremors and chronic problems with the stumps of his legs. Earlier, Mr Pistorius' manager was cross-examined, with prosecutor Gerrie Nel concentrating on the sprinter's reported rows with roommate Arnu Fourie and his love life. On Tuesday, Peet van Zyl  said Mr Pistorius had become a \"global icon\" at the 2012 London Olympics and could have increased his income five or six times. He competed in both the Paralympic and Olympic games. Mr van Zyl said the athlete was also an \"astute businessman\" and there were a lot of opportunities for him because of his raised profile. Our correspondent says that as he sat in the dock, Mr Pistorius must surely have contemplated the future outlined by Mr van Zyl - a future now utterly transformed. 1 2 5 4 6 3 Mr Pistorius said in his statement at the start of the trial that he woke in the early hours and  walked on his stumps to the balcony, pulled in two fans, closed the sliding door and drew curtains. He said that shortly before he had spoken to Reeva, who was in bed beside him. He said he rejected prosecution claims that a witness heard arguing coming from the house before the shooting. Mr Pistorius said he heard the bathroom window sliding open and believed that an intruder, or intruders, had entered the bathroom through a window which was not fitted with burglar bars. \"Unbeknown to me, Reeva must have gone to the toilet in the bathroom at the time I brought in the fans,\" he said. Mr Pistorius said he approached the bathroom armed with his firearm, to defend himself and his girlfriend, believing Ms Steenkamp was still in bed. Both sides agree four bullets were fired. Ms Steenkamp was hit three times. Mr Pistorius said he fired his weapon after hearing a noise in the toilet which he thought was the intruder coming out of the toilet to attack him and Ms Steenkamp. He said he was in a fearful state, knowing he was on his stumps and unable to run away or properly defend himself. Mr Pistorius said he rejected claims that he was on his prostheses when he shot at the door. A witness told the trial she woke to hear a woman screaming and a man shouting for help. She said that after the screams she heard four shots. Mr Pistorius said he went back to the bedroom after shooting at the toilet door, still shouting for Reeva. Lifting himself up onto the bed, he felt over to the right hand side of it and noticed Ms Steenkamp was not there. Mr Pistorius said this was when he realised she could have been in the toilet. Mr Pistorius said he went back to the bathroom but the toilet was locked, so he returned to the bedroom, pulled on his prosthetic legs, turned on the lights before bashing in the toilet door with a cricket bat. Forensics expert Johannes Vermeulen told the court that the height of the marks on the door caused by the cricket bat suggest Mr Pistorius was on his stumps at the time. Mr Pistorius's defence team say he then called security at the gated housing complex and a private paramedic service before carrying Ms Steenkamp downstairs. A security guard claimed it was the other way round, and he had called Mr Pistorius first after reports of gunfire. However, phone records shown to the court revealed Mr Pistorius called the estate manager at 3:19am, a minute later he called the ambulance service and at 3:21am he called estate security. A minute later he received an incoming call - estate security calling him back. According to police phone expert Francois Moller, Mr Pistorius called his friend Justin Divaris a short time later and just after 4:00am he called his brother Carl. Mr Pistorius says he fired multiple shots into a toilet cubicle where Ms Steenkamp was, while in a state of panic. The sprinter and Ms Steenkamp, 29, had been dating for about three months before the shooting. He has often displayed his emotions during the trial, including breaking down in tears in court. There are no juries at trials in South Africa, so the athlete's fate will ultimately be decided by the judge, assisted by two assessors. If found guilty of murder, Mr Pistorius, who went on trial on 3 March, could face life imprisonment. If he is acquitted of that charge, the court will consider an alternative charge of culpable homicide, for which he could - if convicted - receive about 15 years in prison.

{"text":"A steam turbine consists of one or more rotors (rotating discs) mounted on a drive shaft, alternating with a series of stators (static discs) fixed to the turbine casing. The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems.

It would have been the original English dubbed version which I saw - sometimes erroneously referred to as the \"\"Streamline Dub\"\" (the dub was actually by Ghibli themselves and only distributed by Streamline) which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box-set.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately I feel that the release has been partly spoiled by Disney.

They have made some pointless alterations, such as changing the main character's name from \"\"Pazu\"\" to \"\"Patzu\"\", and added some dialogue. But worst of all I feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music - the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to Disney's moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking, which I find annoying in many Disney films.<br \/><br \/>This film still blows away most recent animated films, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

It isn't that this movie is necessarily bad for your health, but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie. You can count the number of pages by Anne Rice that I've read on one hand, but after seeing this movie and Interview with a Vampire, I get the feeling that she writes really good novels. The plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history.<br \/><br \/>Still, Stuart Townsend's voice-over narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than Brad Pitt's vampire narrative ever did, and you can tell that QUEEN OF THE DAMNED's limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the Anne Rice storyline. While Interview decided to go with lace and elegance, QUEEN relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously. One can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places. The costumes and rock & roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack.<br \/><br \/>However, I'll give credit where credit is due. The soundtrack is excellent. Korn and Disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like Butthead.<br \/><br \/>The film opens with a very cool Goth-rock zoom & splice montage, but after the first ten minutes or so, the directing degenerates quickly. It's as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn't enough time and enough money to do an Anne Rice novel justice. What results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects. Unfortunately, QUEEN OF THE DAMNED fails to do the genre justice just as its John Carpenter counterparts fail to impress. Where are the yellow contacts? Where's the pale blue make-up?

It comes as the Kurdish-led fighters advance on Raqqa, IS's self-declared capital. Earlier IS warned that the nearby Tabqa dam could collapse, sparking panic. However, the dam appears intact. The US-led coalition fighting the jihadists denied their claims that it had targeted the facility with airstrikes, leaving it dangerously vulnerable to failure. \"The dam has not been structurally damaged to our knowledge and the coalition seeks to preserve the integrity of the dam as a vital resource to the people of Syria,\" a spokesperson told the BBC. The Tabqa airbase was seized by IS militants in 2014 from the Syrian army. The jihadists then carried out a mass execution of captured soldiers. Its capture by rebels was part of an offensive aimed at also taking control of the dam - the largest in Syria - as well as Tabqa town, on the way to Raqqa. Earlier on Sunday there were conflicting reports about damage to the dam - about 40km (25 miles) upstream of the Raqqa on the Euphrates river - with civilians reportedly fleeing to higher ground. Although IS media channels warned the dam could burst, the militant group later reportedly sent cars around Raqqa with loudspeakers, telling people it was intact and they had no need to evacuate. Aside from being strategically important and providing electricity to the region, the dam complex is believed to be used as an IS headquarters where leaders plot attacks outside Syria, according to the Pentagon. The United Nations recently warned that damage to it could lead to massive-scale flooding. There were similar concerns last year for a dam outside Mosul, an IS stronghold in northern Iraq. If the Mosul dam burst, floodwaters could kill 1.47 million Iraqis living along the River Tigris, the US embassy said. However, the dam has so far remained in operation.

The story reminds me of Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities, in that it is written in a series of vignettes that explains what books mean to each species. There is no plot, but the overarching idea that every species has a means of writing books is bound to be appealing to many readers.Only one of the nominated stories comes from a traditional periodical: Leah Cypess's \"Nanny's Day\" was originally published in Asimov's Science Fiction. This story is also the most traditional in structure, with a straightforward plot and no experimentation with prose style. That doesn't make it boring; quite the contrary.

{"text":"we consider the weak turbulence of whistler waves in the in low-@xmath0 inner magnetosphere of the earth . whistler waves with frequencies , originating in the ionosphere , propagate radially outward and can trigger nonlinear induced scattering by thermal electrons provided the wave energy density is large enough . nonlinear scattering can substantially change the direction of the wave vector of whistler waves and hence the direction of energy flux with only a small change in the frequency . This process of wave scattering can lead to a cascade of energy transfer from larger to smaller scales, ultimately resulting in the dissipation of wave energy as heat or particle acceleration. The weak turbulence of whistler waves plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the inner magnetosphere of the Earth, as it affects the radiation belts and influences the space weather. Understanding the mechanisms of whistler wave generation, propagation and dissipation is therefore of great importance in space physics and in the development of space weather forecasting models. Ongoing research in this field focuses on the study of the nonlinear dynamics of whistler waves, using both theoretical models and experimental observations from satellites such as Cluster, THEMIS and Van Allen Probes.","prompt_len":496.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1288}

{"text":"Crohn's disease (CD) is a complex disorder resulting from the interaction of intestinal microbiota with the host immune system in genetically susceptible individuals. The largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association to date identified 71 CD\u2013susceptibility loci in individuals of European ancestry. An important epidemiological feature of CD is that it is 2\u20134 times more prevalent among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) descent compared to non-Jewish Europeans (NJ). To explore genetic variation associated with CD in AJs, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) by combining raw genotype data across 10 AJ cohorts consisting of 907 cases and 2,345 controls in the discovery stage, followed up by a replication study in 971 cases and 2,124 controls. We confirmed genome-wide significant associations of 9 known CD loci in AJs and replicated 3 additional loci with strong signal (p<5\u00d710 \u22126 ). Novel signals detected among AJs were mapped to chromosomes 5q21.1 (rs7705924, combined p = 2\u00d710 \u22128 ; combined odds ratio OR = 1.48), 2p15 (rs6545946, p = 7\u00d710 \u22129 ; OR = 1.16), 8q21.11 (rs12677663, p = 2\u00d710 \u22128 ; OR = 1.15), 10q26.3 (rs10734105, p = 3\u00d710 \u22128 ; OR = 1.27), and 11q12.1 (rs11229030, p = 8\u00d710 \u22129 ; OR = 1.15), implicating biologically plausible candidate genes, including RPL7, CPAMD8, PRG2, and PRG3. In all, the 16 replicated and newly discovered loci, in addition to the three coding NOD2 variants, accounted for 11.2% of the total genetic variance for CD risk in the AJ population. This study demonstrates the complementary value of genetic studies in the Ashkenazim.Crohn's disease causes inflammation of the digestive tract resulting from the interaction of normal gut bacteria with the host immune system in genetically predisposed individuals. People of Jewish heritage have an increased risk of developing Crohn's disease compared to non-Jewish Europeans. So far, 71 genetic variants that increase the risk of Crohn's disease have been identified in individuals of European ancestry. Here, we take advantage of recent technical and methodological advances to explore Crohn's diseases-related genetic variants specific to the Ashkenazi Jewish population. We examined 6,347 individuals whose Jewish ancestry was confirmed by a large number of genetic markers and detected several variants associated with the increased risk of Crohn' disease. We confirmed the involvement of 12 known Crohn's disease risk variants in Ashkenazi Jews and identified novel genetic regions not previously found in non-Jewish European populations. Further studies of these regions may help discover biological pathways affecting susceptibility to Crohn's disease and lead to the development of novel treatments. This study also demonstrates the complementary value of genetic studies in isolated populations, like the Ashkenazim.Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease resulting from dysregulated mucosal immune responses to enteric microbiota which arise in genetically susceptible individuals (reviewed in [10] ).

{"text":"A new scheme in Northern Ireland is attempting to tackle the issue in order to save lives. Figures from the Public Health Agency show that from March 2012 to April 2015, the number of people turning up at EDs with self-harm injuries increased by 11% from 5,977 to 6,630. The majority were young people aged between 15 and 24. At Antrim Area Hospital, physical and mental health specialists are working as a team to ensure vulnerable men and women are detected and are offered treatment quickly. It is hoped that RAID - or Rapid Assessment Interface Discharge - will be rolled out across all the health trusts. Alan is a patient who has been helped by the scheme. Late on a Friday evening, he was brought by the police to Antrim's ED in a distressed state. They had found him in his car desperately needing medical assistance. When he arrived at the ED, surrounded by people with flu and broken limbs, his mental health issues could easily have gone undetected. \"I just felt really down, I was suicidal and was going to end my life,\" he said. Instead, within two hours, Alan was seen by a mental health specialist who is part of the RAID team. A programme was put in place which included medication and counselling, and contact was made with his GP. This package of care not only saved his life but ensured ongoing support when he was discharged several hours later. He says this was key: \"It's extremely important. Without it, I may not have come back.\" Dr Uzma Huda, a consultant psychiatrist who is part of the 24-hour emergency team, said: \"We need to have parity of physical and mental health because people's mental health needs quite often are overlooked when ever they come to a physical health setting like an acute hospital. \"So if you have depression and it has been overlooked but the nursing staff in the acute wards are picking that up, the RAID team can come, see you, start you on treatment, liaise with your GP and that starts you on a journey to recovery.\" According to clinicians in Antrim, the RAID scheme means they are preventing a majority of men and women who are at risk from mental health problems from slipping through the net. One woman, who asked the BBC to protect her identity, said the scheme meant the right care package was in place for her elderly mother who had been admitted with delayed-onset delirium. The team ensured a care package was also available in the community once she was discharged. \"It meant she was seen very quickly, diagnosed very quickly, and there were links made within the hospital in order to get her a very quick package of care so that she was able to return home the next day,\" said the daughter. While the number of mental health referrals has increased, so too has the pace of people being discharged from hospital - people who should not have been admitted in the first place. That means they are being cared from at home in the community instead of being in a hospital setting. John Dickson, operations manager with the RAID service, explained the concept behind the scheme. \"Early diagnosis and treatment means a shorter stay for the patient, fewer bed days for the hospital and a better outcome ultimately for the patient,\" he said. Staff are hailing this scheme as a success. While it does require additional funding, they say it is saving the health service money in the long run as prevention is keeping vulnerable people out of a long stay in hospital.

{"text":"As a talented youngster it was 'should he play football, or cricket?' He chose professional football, first on the books of Blackburn Rovers, then on loan at Rochdale, in Belgium with Cercle Bruges, and Northwich Victoria. Then, when he gave up football to play first-class cricket, it was 'should he play for Warwickshire or his native Lancashire?'. He chose the Bears. Now, after eight increasingly successful years at Edgbaston, the last six of them as an automatic Bears first-team choice, the left-arm all-rounder could have another big decision to make. England or West Indies? \"I've been asked it a lot over the years,\" Barker told BBC Sport. \"Would I play for England or the West Indies? But nothing has been approached to me about it.\" At 29, it now looks increasingly clear that England are never going to consider him - despite a lot of plaudits on the back of an almost unrivalled haul of 257 wickets in 70 County Championship games since 2012. But there is another option open to this Lancastrian son of a West Indian, whose godfather is the great Clive Lloyd. Could he really play for the Windies? \"I'd be open to it obviously,\" said Barker. \"But it would be a possible lifestyle change. I'd probably have to up and move. I couldn't just walk straight into the squad. You have to play so many games - and I'd have to perform in them too. \"I've no issue with not being selected by England. They might see me only as being a good county player and that's fine as I never even thought I'd do that in the first place. \"I'm proud to have achieved what I have. I don't want to look back thinking I could have done more. If I was to be given some sort of recognition internationally, it would have most likely happened by now. But. if that means I finish without ever playing at international level, I'd still be happy.\" Keith Barker Sr played first-class cricket for his native British Guiana, in the early 1960s, sharing the same team as such West Indies greats Lloyd, Lance Gibbs, Basil Butcher, Clyde Walcott and Rohan Kanhai. And, as a Lancastrian son of a West Indian, Keith Barker Jr he admits he was born to play cricket. \"I'm told I had a cricket bat in my hand before I could walk,\" said Manchester-born Barker, who grew up in Accrington, while his father was professional at various nearby Lancashire League clubs, including Great Harwood, Enfield and Rishton. \"I was always playing with my brothers,\" he recalls. \"We used to play on the driveway when it was sunny, with a skateboard for stumps, leaned up against the garage door. \"I played my first Under-13s game at the age of six when one lad didn't turn up, I trialled with Lancashire Under-11s at eight and, at one point, we had all four of us brothers playing for Enfield, in different teams.\" The Barker family's cricketing roots go back even further. Of his three brothers, Garfield, or Gary for short, was named after the great Garfield Sobers, while Andy, whose middle name is Lance, was named in honour of Warwickshire and West Indies spin legend Gibbs. As for Barker himself, he was given the same middle name Hubert as one of his father's best friends, the great former Windies captain Lloyd who became his godfather. Having played for Lancashire through the age groups, he had a trial for England Under-15s, when Paul Farbrace, now England assistant coach, was involved, playing alongside Worcestershire and England all-rounder Moeen Ali and his future Bears captain Varun Chopra. \"I played with Chops from the age of 11 to 15, when we both played for England Under-15s. In fact, there were a few times when my mum and dad couldn't make it and his mum and dad used to take me,\" he said. \"But I kind of fell out of love at 15 with cricket, as to how it was structured. I was opening the bowling and batting three but I was told I couldn't do that. Then when I did get an opportunity to prove myself I really messed up. \"I'd told the coach I wasn't happy so he let me bat at four. We were playing the Netherlands. I'd always been brought up by my dad that a bad ball's a bad ball whenever it comes. I got this big juicy full toss first ball. I was kind of feeling the pressure that I can't fail as I'd made such a fuss about playing, But I pulled out halfway through and ended up being caught and bowled. \"Next game I was back to batting nine and second change again.\" Keith Barker's first big problem in life was that, apart from loving cricket, he was pretty good at football too. This lifelong Manchester United fan has played cricket against Joe Hart, shared the same football pitch as Vincent Kompany and, on some cold mornings, he can still feel the damage a slightly mistimed Lee Cattermole challenge once did to his ankle in his early days at Blackburn. In his Rochdale days he played against four future Premier League players - Kasper Schmeichel (then at Bury), Mike Williamson (then at Wycombe), Dave Edwards (Shrewsbury) and Jon Walters, who was in the same Chester team as a future Premier League manager, Roberto Martinez. But, just like with his cricket, his football career also kicked off. \"I remember when I was five my brother grabbing my taking me into living room, moving the coffee table to one side and telling me he was going to teach me the 'step over',\" he said. \"I started playing for Huncoat United at nine. I played left wing when I was growing up, a left wing who never tracked back,\" he grins. \"But I was still scouted by Blackburn and I ended up signing a contract there.\" Blackburn had two managers at the helm in his days at Ewood Park, first Graeme Souness, then Mark Hughes. \"He was a scary bloke Souness,\" he recalls. \"I remember the odd fiery training session. He certainly didn't hold back in challenges. \"You didn't want to get on the wrong side of him. I never saw any player cross him.\" But, while Barker still had a chance of making it under Souness, it was a different story when Hughes took over. He explained: \"Mark Hughes told me 'You're a decent player. But I'm always going to buy my strikers from abroad'.\" It led to Barker joining Blackburn's feeder club Cercle Bruges for the 2005-06 season. \"They only played 4-5-1, with one striker, which wasn't me. I'd been there two months when I had a chat with the manager,\" he added. \"He said 'I've got to be honest with you, I didn't want a striker'. I knew my time was up.\" He ended up doing well at Rochdale until manager Steve Parkin got sacked, was on trial north of the border at Scottish minnows Gretna when they were on the up and turned down a three-year deal at Royal Antwerp, Manchester United's feeder club. Five months with St Patrick's Athletic in Ireland were largely spent injured, followed by a summer trial at Bury, only for their manager Chris Casper to get sacked too, in January 2008, after which his final footballing stop was Northwich Victoria. \"I pretty much gave up on football. You have to hit the ground running when on trial or signing for a new club. My nephew had the same when he was over from Australia on trial at Oldham. He played a one-off trial and trained for a few days with the under-21s. \"He was told they'd be looking to sign him, only to then be told a week later that they'd managed to get the player on loan who they were after earlier in the season, so he wouldn't be needed. He's now back in Australia playing football.\" When Barker signed his Blackburn deal, Lancashire also offered him a contract - three days too late. \"From 16 to 21, I didn't play much cricket at all. Apart from Lancs calling me out of the blue to come and play in a game against Sri Lanka A when I was 18, I played for Enfield about 10 or 12 times.\" Then came a fateful day in late March 2008 - when his father died. \"I was 100% sure nothing would happen with cricket, so I was just looking for a job. But dad called (Lancashire Academy boss) John Stanworth to let him know I was coming back to cricket, just to do the right thing. It was the next afternoon my dad passed. \"I took 20 wickets in five games for Enfield, and was being watched Lancashire, then I got told (Warwickshire coach) Ashley Giles was looking for a left-armer and had spoken to David Lloyd, who I've known for a long time, as he's been involved with Accrington all his life. I'd played with his youngest lad Ben, and Graham, his eldest son, also played for Accrington when he finished with Lancashire. \"Keith Piper watched me and offered me a trial. I scored 118 and that's when Lancs took notice. An old family friend saw on Teletext a headline 'Ex-footballer scores a hundred' and questions started to be asked. \"John Stanworth took more interest in getting me to go up there and have a trial but I'd already been offered a contract by Warwickshire. And it was a two-year deal. Lancashire only offered a year. My mind was already made up and I felt a fresh start was a good thing.\" Eight years on, lots of wickets and lots of new friends made, and with two years left on his contract, how long before Barker thinks about another fresh start? BBC Coventry & Warwickshire's Clive Eakin If Keith Barker never gets a full international call-up, as now seems likely, he would surely feature prominently on lists of the best cricketers not to have played for England. It's his perceived lack of pace that has had successive selectors doubting his ability to step up to the elite level. That invites discussion as to whether England are too hung up on the importance of pace. Barker, with his left-arm over, offers something different. And, once again, he's proven in 2016 that he can take wickets with impressive regularity. He passed 50 for the season in the Championship, as well as scoring over 500 runs. It's no coincidence that the one bowler in the First Division to claim more victims has been his county colleague Jeetan Patel. Warwickshire make no secret of the way the New Zealand spinner exploits Barker's footmarks. Warwickshire are keen to protect Barker from wear and tear by using him rarely in white-ball cricket. It's an understandable policy but the Bears would surely not have flopped so badly in Twenty20 if Barker had played more. ","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":10113}

This resulted in the removal of Sky channels from Virgin Media's cable service, which led to a court battle between the two companies. The dispute was finally resolved in 2010, with Virgin Media agreeing to pay BSkyB for access to its channels on cable TV.\n\nDespite this resolution, tensions between the two companies continued to simmer, with BSkyB accusing Virgin Media of using its dominant position in the cable TV market to gain an unfair advantage over its competitors. In response, Virgin Media argued that BSkyB was trying to stifle competition and maintain its dominance in the pay-TV market.\n\nThe rivalry between the two companies came to a head in 2011, when News Corporation (which owns BSkyB) attempted to take full control of the company by acquiring the remaining 61% of shares it did not own. The bid was met with widespread opposition from politicians, media watchdogs and the public, who were concerned about News Corporation's potential influence on the UK media landscape.\n\nFollowing a public inquiry, the bid was ultimately abandoned in 2012, and News Corporation's relationship with BSkyB was forever altered. Despite this setback, BSkyB has continued to thrive, expanding its range of services and growing its customer base to become one of the largest pay-TV providers in the UK. Meanwhile, Virgin Media has focused on its broadband and mobile offerings, and remains a major player in the UK telecoms market.","prompt_len":107.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1540}

Michigan St. since 1978 disappeared from its prominent perch at some time within the past month. Its fate is unknown, but a pair of dumpsters parked outside the former Blue Cross Blue Shield headquarters, where the sculpture had been located, provide an ominous portent.The Brutalist-style building, vacant since 2006, is undergoing conversion to 200 apartment units and will be known as The 401.The sculpture, \"Peter John,\" was commissioned by the insurance giant as a site-specific work to complement the building. The $200,000 commission was awarded to a 30-year old sculptor John Raimondi, who designed a 36ft. x 27ft. x 13ft. angular counterpoint to the severe architecture of the 11-story, 200,000-plus square foot building, taking into account the building's beveled facade, a triangular plaza where the sculpture rested, and the large scale of the buildings in the area. The 1970s was the high point for monumental geometric minimalism in sculpture.So, after 38 years in place, where did it go?John Mangel, the developer of the apartment conversion, did not respond by telephone or email to requests for comment on what happened to the sculpture. Nor was anybody on site during a visit Friday afternoon.If the thing had been whisked away to a factory for conservation, or relocated to a sculpture garden somewhere, Mangel probably would have been the first to say so. So, his silence is not good news.The move took the sculptor by surprise, Raimondi tells Urban Milwaukee. And he's not happy about it.\"I'm sure they destroyed it,\" he said in a telephone message from his studio in Palm Beach Gardens Florida. He has produced over 100 \"monumental\" works of sculpture in 30 states. \"Peter John\" dates from Raimondi's early \"Geometric Minimalism\" series of the 1970s. The sculpture is named in honor of his father.Could things have been handled differently? Yes, says Raimondi. \"It's too bad they didn't reach out to me. I would have loved to buy that sculpture back.\"Raimondi says he would have gladly spent his own money to buy the sculpture back. Apparently, that simple win-win solution never occurred to the developer.

Life sometimes has boring patches, no real plot, and not necessarily a happy ending. \"\"A River Runs Through It\"\" is the perfect name for this film (and Norman Maclean's novel). It captures the essence of life, the ups and downs, the beauty and the harshness of it all. The film tells the story of two brothers, their love for fly-fishing and the challenges they face in their relationships with each other and their father. It doesn't have a Hollywood-style happy ending but rather a bittersweet conclusion that leaves the viewers with a sense of nostalgia and reflection.\n\nWhat stood out to me while watching this film was how it beautifully depicted the scenery and the importance of nature in our lives. The scenes of the river flowing and the fish jumping were mesmerizing, but it was the conversations between the characters while fishing that were truly captivating. They talked about life, love, and what it means to truly enjoy and appreciate the little things in life.\n\nOverall, I think \"A River Runs Through It\" is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates the beauty of life and wants to be inspired to live in the moment. It's a film that reminds us that life can be unpredictable and challenging, but it's our perspective and the people we share it with that truly make it worth living.","prompt_len":229.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1350}

The first is the economic factor of the period; the Normans were rich and thus were able to make large-scale purchases and build castles which could act as permanent residence for the family and garrison (as opposed to a fort, which was built to defend the family of the laird, and which only did so if a laird needed it). These large castles would create powerful families, often to rival the lairds, and thus have a large influence upon Scotland.

{"text":"Today we are going to look at StackPHP and try to understand what this thing is all about. Although this post will have some code, this article will be rather theoretical as we are interested in learning what StackPHP actually is, where it comes from and why it is useful.As the front page of the StackPHP project says, Stack is a convention for composing HttpKernelInterface middlewares. But, in order to actually understand this definition, we will have to cover a few concepts first. At the end, we will also illustrate the concepts we learned in the context of StackPHP with some example code. This usually makes things much easier to understand.What is the HttpKernelInterface?--ADVERTISEMENT--The HttpKernelInterface can be defined as more than one thing. At its most basic level, it is a PHP interface found inside the Symfony HttpKernel component. But it is more than that. It is a modern PHP pattern that allows us to treat HTTP requests in an object oriented way instead of dealing with superglobals and output functions like echo or header .But what does this actually mean?The interface provides a single method called handle() that accepts a $request and is expected to return a $response . The latter are basically wrapper objects around the HTTP specification. For example, in Symfony, it is the responsibility of the HttpFoundation component to create and manage these. So as you can imagine, the $request object contains data about the current user request, while the $response object is responsible for outputting the result of processing the request. But this is already a digression.The interface doesn't really care about what happens inside the handle() method. This is the responsibility of the class that implements it. For example, the Symfony kernel uses the Event Dispatcher component for managing this. It dispatches a number of events, and listeners to these events handle most of the heavy lifting. This keeps things abstract and decoupled.But to get back to the point, you can regard the HttpKernelInterface as a very simple OO pattern that helps organise the handling of an incoming request for the purpose of turning it into a response.What is the decorator pattern?Like many other programming patterns, the decorator pattern is an object oriented way of solving a particular problem. In this case, the problem relates to extending functionality within a class without actually modifying or actually extending the class. The solution is to rather decorate it with the additional needed functionality.Let's quickly see a code example as it is the easiest way to understand what this pattern is all about.Imagine you have this Action interface and class:interface ActionInterface { public function trigger(); } class Action implements ActionInterface { private function performAction() { return 'Action performed'; } public function trigger() { return $this->performAction(); } }And you want to be able to provide multiple different versions of this class that contain additional functionality inside the trigger() method.

{"text":"He is not a man given to emotional outbursts or shows of passion. But the Liberal Democrat business secretary is at the centre of a political whirlwind right now. In comments recorded by undercover reporters from the Daily Telegraph, Mr Cable says he has \"declared war on Rupert Murdoch\" and plans to block the media baron's efforts to take full control of BSkyB. The remarks have led to him being stripped of his powers to make a decision on the bid - and were criticised by Downing Street as \"totally unacceptable and inappropriate\", although he will remain as business secretary. In the recordings Mr Cable also spoke of an ongoing \"battle\" to curb the Tories' ideas and promote his own party's. He even hinted that he might take the \"nuclear option\" and resign if the Lib Dems do not get enough of their own way. Such an act of self-sacrifice would follow one of the longest ascents to political power imaginable. Now 67, he was a contemporary of the likes of Ken Clarke, Michael Howard and Norman Lamont - some of the Tory \"big beasts\" of the 1990s - while at Cambridge University. But, while they enjoyed a reasonably rapid journey to influence at Westminster, the struggle for Mr Cable was long and complex. A grammar school boy from York, he initially joined the Liberal Party but, after university, defected to Labour. He fought for the Glasgow Hillhead seat at the 1970 election, losing. As a Labour councillor in Glasgow he contributed to The Red Paper on Scotland, edited by Gordon Brown in 1975. In 1982, Mr Cable changed party once more, this time opting for the newly formed Social Democratic Party. He made failed attempts to run for Parliament in 1983 and 1987. After the SDP and the old Liberal Party merged to form the Liberal Democrats in 1988, Mr Cable was unsuccessful in another bid to become an MP in 1992. It was not until the anti-Tory landslide of 1997 that he finally won the seat of Twickenham, south-west London, which he holds to this day. Along the way, he worked as an economics lecturer, at the Foreign Office, as a special adviser to future Labour leader John Smith, an official in the Kenyan government and as chief economist for the oil company Shell. It is fair to say Mr Cable has travelled a bit. Once in Parliament, his political career went comparatively smoothly, with promotion to the Lib Dem front bench in 1999 and to Treasury spokesman in 2003. In this influential role he made pronouncements on the unsustainability of Labour's long economic boom - comments which saw his reputation rise following the arrival of the credit crunch. He was also one of the first senior politicians to call for Northern Rock to be nationalised. Mr Cable helped to oust Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy in 2005, but it was after Mr Kennedy's successor, Sir Menzies Campbell, resigned after two years in the job, that Mr Cable became a household name, at least among those with a modicum of interest in politics. Having been elected deputy leader, he stood in at prime minister's questions and in a memorable exchange mocked Gordon Brown, remarking on the \"prime minister's remarkable transformation in the last few weeks from Stalin to Mr Bean, creating chaos out of order rather than order out of chaos\". The laughter rang around the Commons chamber, emboldening this previously rather dry figure. Mr Cable, a naturally shy man, was enjoying himself in public. He has hardly been out of the media since. He was one of the few big-hitters among the Lib Dem leadership and when no party won overall control of the Commons after the 2010 election there were suggestions he might become chancellor under the Tory-Lib Dem government. However, the job went to George Osborne and Mr Cable was given the business brief - in charge of a department he had previously suggested should be abolished. Since then, government has proved far less easy than opposition. Mr Cable's highest-profile task has been oversee the controversial rise in university tuition fees to a maximum of \u00c2\u00a39,000 a year. This came despite the Lib Dems signing a pre-election pledge to oppose any such move, which has made him and party leader Nick Clegg the focus of much anger. Mr Cable voiced doubt about whether he should back the plans in Parliament. Eventually he and all his Lib Dem ministerial colleagues did so, in the face of a large rebellion by the party's backbench MPs. Mr Cable has been more certain in backing the coalition's deficit-reduction programme, but made some occasionally confusing comments. At his party's annual conference in September, he criticised capitalism itself, accusing it of killing competition, baffling many of the Lib Dems' Conservative partners in government. Indeed, the conflict between big ideas - rather than the day-to-day grind of politics - seems to animate him most. His comments to the undercover Telegraph reporters are less surprising in this context. He was recorded calling the coalition's attempts to push through changes in the health service, local government and other areas a \"kind of Maoist revolution\", which was \"in danger of getting out of control\". Opponents might accuse Mr Cable of inconsistency, some going on to question his reliability and willingness to take collective responsibility for government decisions. Supporters might call it a refreshing independence, born of decades of intense intellectual activity. There is, though, little doubt Mr Cable appears to enjoy being a big figure in politics, whatever his travails. Occasional glimpses of the private man come through too. Mr Cable is an accomplished ballroom dancer, who will be appearing on a Strictly Come Dancing Christmas special. His detractors say such exuberant activity is insensitive at a time of austerity, but others argue that attempts to humanise politics can only be a good thing. He is also a father of three grown-up children by his first wife, Olympia, who was from Kenya. Even here, Mr Cable bucked 1960s convention by a mixed-race marriage, despite opposition from his father, who told him such unions \"didn't work\". After Olympia was diagnosed with cancer for a second time in the 1990s, he combined the roles of being an MP and her carer until her death in 2001. Mr Cable remarried in 2004. Mr Cable said he \"fully accepts\" the decision to strip him of his powers - he had said earlier he had no intention of resigning from the government. Whether, given his remarks about Rupert Murdoch, Mr Cable's future is in his own hands remains to be seen. ","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":6488}

JAB, a Luxembourg-based investment firm, is owned by the billionaire Reimann family, which paid $1.35bn for Krispy Kreme last year. Panera's origins began 36 years ago, under the Au Bon Pain name, with one outlet in Boston. In 1993 the company bought Saint Louis Bread Company which had 20 branches at the time. Four years later it changed the chain's name to to Panera Bread. In 1999 it sold all its other businesses, including Au Bon Pain, to concentrate investment on Panera. Panera now has more than 2,000 restaurants across the US. It employs about 100,000 people and has annual sales of $5bn. The chain focuses on healthier, additive-free foods. Founder and chairman Ron Shaich said: \"Panera has been the best-performing restaurant stock of the past 20 years - up over 8,000%. Today's transaction is a direct reflection of those efforts and delivers substantial additional value for our shareholders.\" JAB will also take on about $340m of Panera's debt, the companies said. It is paying 41 times earnings to take control of Panera - a very hefty premium the level of which is more common in the technology sector. Olivier Goudet, chief executive of JAB, said:  \"We have long admired Ron and the incredible success story he has created at Panera.

{"text":"The smaller the economic inequality, the more waste and pollution is created, resulting in many cases, in more environmental degradation. This can be explained by the fact that as the poor people in the society become more wealthy, it increases their yearly carbon emissions. This relation is expressed by the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC).[not in citation given] It should be noted here however that in certain cases, with great economic inequality, there is nonetheless not more waste and pollution created as the waste\/pollution is cleaned up better afterwards (water treatment, filtering, ...).... Also note that the whole of the increase in environmental degradation is the result of the increase of emissions per person being multiplied by a multiplier. If there were fewer people however, this multiplier would be lower, and thus the amount of environmental degradation would be lower as well. As such, the current high level of population has a large impact on this as well. If (as WWF argued), population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level (1\/3 of current levels, so about 2 billion people), human inequality can be addressed\/corrected, while still not resulting in an increase of environmental damage.","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":1230}

Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. Phagocytosis evolved as a means of acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism.

It's a beautiful coming of age story, full of heart and soul.\n\nThe performances are outstanding, especially the lead actor who plays the charismatic lead singer of the band. The music is also fantastic, blending rock and roll with traditional Iranian sounds. It's a shame that the Iranian government decided to ban this movie, as it could have been an opportunity to showcase the diversity and talent of Iranian culture.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that this movie is not a political statement against Iran or its people. It's simply a story about young people trying to find their place in the world and pursue their dreams. It's a universal theme that everyone can relate to, regardless of their country or background.\n\nIn conclusion, \"No One Knows About Persian Cats\" is a must-see movie, not just for its cultural significance, but for its beautiful storytelling, performances, and music.

And I must say, the first quarter of the movie was good! It really portrayed the black music scene back then. But when it came to the last quarter, its final act, things started becoming a little strange. At one point, it seems that the film completely switched gears. I don't know exactly what was going on, but after the scene where she and her bandmates perform the song, we see that they're now singing the same song performed by the band that they were in during the scene when the movie first revealed their connection to Dreamgirls. It was a bit jarring, especially for people who were unfamiliar with the band.The only way I can explain why it was jarring was to compare it to the band performed by the characters in the first two movies. In those movies, the people were performing songs from the scene in which the group first started performing, and the scenes where the two characters were in, so that they could meet, became a staple of the film. That's how scenes like the one where Johnny sings the Temptations' \"I Feel Love\" became iconic. This happens also in the scene where the other bandmembers perform on the MTV show. The first time I saw it, I didn't even notice that the band that was performing here was not the one from the first movie. I've seen people compare the scene to the scene where The Monkees, in the same way people had mentioned The Monkees' iconic \"I Just Had Sex\" scene, but that scene's a whole different movie entirely. That scene is fromon one different day, before The Monkees was on, which means that it should probably be viewed by people with far more familiarity with the band's career, because while it perfectly sets the scene about what a momentous moment that was in The Monkees' career, it's probably a little bit more jarring than being forced to see the Dreamgirls performances at the end of The Monkees.But, if that's","prompt_len":245.0,"label":"gpt2","text_length":2009}

{"text":"Several improvements are desirable for how Namecoin Core creates name transactions:Register names without having to unlock the wallet twice, 12 blocks apart.Coin Control (a method of improving anonymity).Specifying a fee based on when you need the transaction to be confirmed.Pure name transactions (a method of improving scalability of Namecoin by decreasing transaction size).All of these improvements, though they seem quite different in nature, have one important thing in common: they need to use the raw transaction API in ways that Namecoin Core doesn't make easy.What's the raw transaction API?Simply put, the raw transaction API is a Bitcoin Core feature that allows the user to create custom transactions at a much lower level than what a typical user would want. The raw transaction API gives you a lot of power and flexibility, but it's also more cumbersome and, if used incorrectly, you can accidentally lose lots of money.Why do those features need the raw transaction API?The raw transaction API is useful for a few reasons. First, it lets you create and sign transactions independently from broadcasting them. That means you can create and sign a name_firstupdate transaction before its preceding name_new transaction has been broadcast. Second, it gives you direct control over the inputs, outputs, and fees for the transaction, whereas the standard name commands instead pick defaults for you that you might not like and can't change.What's wrong with Namecoin Core's raw transaction API?It's not raw enough! First off, the only name transactions it can create are name_update ; it can't create name_new or name_firstupdate transactions. That rules out handling name registrations, and consequently means that anonymously registering names or controlling the fee for name registrations is a no-go. Secondly, it can't create name_update outputs with a higher monetary value than the default 0.01 NMC. That rules out pure name transactions.How are we fixing this?We're making an API change. Instead of trying to stuff name operation data into createrawtransaction , where it doesn't belong and where it's extremely difficult to provide the needed flexibility, we're removing name support from createrawtransaction and moving it to a new RPC call, namerawtransaction . The new workflow replaces the previous createrawtransaction with two steps:Use createrawtransaction just like you would with Bitcoin, and specify a currency output of 0.01 NMC for where you want the name output to be. Use namerawtransaction to prepend a name operation to the scriptPubKey of the aforementioned currency output. This has the effect of converting that currency output into a name output.What will be the impact?Users of the raw transaction API will need to update their code. If you're using the raw transaction API to create currency transactions, then this will actually allow you to delete your Namecoin-specific customizations, since it will be just like Bitcoin again. If you're using the raw transaction API to create name transactions (this includes people who are doing atomic name trading), you'll need to refactor your createrawtransaction -using code so that it also calls namerawtransaction . If you're a hacker who enjoys experimenting, this new workflow will probably be much more to your liking, as it","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":3315}
{"text":"But many of the problems of 2015 could get worse this year, from lack of demand for the continent's commodities, to lack of rain, from falling currencies to political instability. The editor of BBC Africa's Business Report, Matthew Davies, takes a look at the prospects for African economies in 2016: Prices for Africa's commodities fell sharply in 2015 and are not expected to see much of a recovery this year. This has had widespread economic effects across the continent. Many African countries heavily rely on exports of their natural resources, such as oil, minerals, and agricultural products. With the global demand for these commodities weakening, African economies have struggled to create jobs and maintain government revenues. In addition to the drop in commodity prices, several countries faced devastating droughts in 2015, which led to food shortages and production losses in key sectors. The continued political unrest and conflict in countries like South Sudan, Somalia, and Libya have also impeded economic growth and foreign investment. However, some countries have managed to weather the storm better than others by diversifying their economies, investing in infrastructure, and promoting entrepreneurship. Davies notes that in 2016, African economies will need to continue these efforts and seek new partnerships with other regions to overcome the challenges and seize opportunities for growth.","prompt_len":474.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1414}

Researchers were able to show that the difference between its radius as measured to the equator and the radius measured to the poles was just 3km. \"This makes Kepler 11145123 the roundest natural object ever measured,\" said lead author Prof Laurent Gizon. He added that it was \"even more round than the Sun\". Prof Gizon, from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS), and his colleagues used a technique called asteroseismology - the study of how stars pulsate, or oscillate. Nasa's Kepler space telescope observed the star's oscillations continuously for more than four years. The periodic expansions and contractions of Kepler 11145123 can be gleaned from fluctuations in its brightness. And from these data, astronomers were able to extract information about its shape. Using the method, Prof Gizon and his colleagues discovered that the star rotated faster at the surface than in the core, contributing to an unexpected rounding of its form. The difference of 3km, between the polar and equatorial radii, is tiny compared to the star's mean radius of 1.5 million km. The authors say that this distortion is probably caused by factors other than rotation alone. They suggest that a weak magnetic field surrounds the star, making the star appear even more rounded.

{"text":"The 28-year-old medical equipment salesman is trying to find a girlfriend at speed-dating events, but without much luck so far. Over a pot of tea in a restaurant, he tells me he is having no more success in finding a property that he can afford. Despite prices falling sharply in Hangzhou, Jian is still struggling to find a place of his own -even with a decent salary. \"I'm keeping a very close eye on the falling prices, and will keep doing that,\" he says, between slurps of chrysanthemum flower tea. Prices across China surged in the decade up until the beginning of this year. The government decided to try to take some heat out of the market, so people like Jian would have a chance of buying. The policy seems to have worked, but perhaps a little too well. Property values have recently been falling fast in many Chinese cities, and some say that a property bubble could be bursting. At one property development here in eastern Hangzhou, the asking price of new apartments has been reduced by 25%, compared to the original sales price in 2011. The show flat is decorated very extravagantly, with a chandelier in the living room and a large walk-in wardrobe as big as a bedroom. The sales agent, who only gives her name as Miss Wang, shows me around. She explains it is a \"perfect apartment\" for a three-person family - a family that can afford $900,000 (\u00c2\u00a3530.000), that is. \"The banks have tighter cash flow. People think the government might launch something like a property tax. That would make the price go a bit lower so buyers have started to wait and see,\" she explains. Developers and builders seem keen to cash in as soon as they can. \"The real estate developer wants to get their investment back. That's why we're giving a better discount,\" she says. The risk for developers is that buyers will continue to wait, and so prices will continue to fall. Yet despite falling prices, it seems as if Hangzhou is ringed by building sites. In one northern suburb, a dozen apartment blocks are being built. They're going up at quite a speed. At one, a man in a white hard hat is precariously balanced on the edge of a lower floor, banging in some flooring. A man next to him is leaning down, cigarette in mouth, to grab a saw. At another building site, a large, bright red sign publicises the fact that the aim is to shift these new flats as quickly as possible. It offers \"zero deposit and 0% interest rates\". For many economists this has all the hallmarks of a property bubble, though they disagree about whether it is bursting or merely deflating. \"Housing construction has some kind of bubble, since there have been many investments in the sector,\" says Cai Fang, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) and an adviser to the government. Sitting in his central Beijing office, he highlights the balancing act the authorities are trying to pull off. \"The central government wants to see the falling prices, but at the same time wants it to go slowly.\" Yet, in Hangzhou, some of the price falls have been fast. One property developer's office in the city was smashed up by buyers. They were angry they had paid more for their apartments a year ago than their new neighbours were now paying. \"A lot in China depends on confidence, and it's a matter of trying to get the middle class to think the value of their investment will go up again,\" says Jonathan Fenby, China director at Trusted Sources. It's not just households' balance sheets which are exposed. The property market - including construction, furnishing, sales of white goods and so on - is varyingly estimated to make up 15-30% of China's economy. Jonathan Fenby warns that there's a risk for the Chinese economy and its leaders too. \"If there were a serious property crash, that would be politically a very big danger.\" But it could be good news for Ye Jian, the man in Hangzhou searching for an apartment. \"I hope the prices keep going down,\" he says. He's carrying on search for a girlfriend, too. He didn't find anyone he liked at the speed-dating event. ","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":4064}

{"text":"About 4,000 heads across 17 councils, mostly in southern England, are writing to their MPs warning that schools face job losses and cuts to subjects. They say that the current level of school funding is \"unsustainable\". The Department for Education says that it is committed to increasing levels of school funding. But there is uncertainty over the Conservatives' manifesto promise for an extra \u00a31bn per year, as that depended on funding from scrapping universal infant free meals - a proposal which is no longer confirmed. Ministers say they are \"reflecting\" on plans for school meals and \"will come forward with proposals in due course\". The education department has so far not presented a revised plan for school funding - and head teachers are calling for urgent \"clarity\" on resolving budget shortfalls. The head teachers, writing a joint letter to MPs, say they are concerned about \"being placed in the unwanted position of having to ask parents for regular financial contributions in order to prop up our devastated budgets\". The heads are in 17 authorities with many Conservative MPs, in Brighton, Cambridgeshire, Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, East Sussex, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire, Peterborough, Suffolk, Surrey, Thurrock, West Sussex and Wokingham. They say they have been asking for a decision on budgets for two years, but \"unfortunately schools continue to wait in vain for improved funding\". Head teachers want to know whether extra money pledged in the manifesto is \"still on the table\" and details of minimum per pupil funding levels. They are also calling for a clear timetable for the implementation of the new National Funding Formula, which is meant to tackle inconsistencies in the amounts received by individual schools. Adding to the pressure on funding are calls for the lifting of the cap on public sector pay, which could see increases in teachers' salaries. The pay review body for teachers' pay is expected to publish its recommendations in the summer. If a bigger increase is proposed and accepted by the government, this would require a further increase in the budget for schools, with teachers' pay representing the biggest slice of school spending. Jules White, the West Sussex head teacher who has co-ordinated the letter to MPs, says a pay increase for teachers would be welcome, but it needs to be fully funded. \"Our campaign is focused on adequate funding... to ensure that there are enough teachers, support staff and equipment in every school. \"It's no good just awarding a pay increase if this squeezes school budgets and overall resources still further,\" he said. The Department for Education said that it was considering plans for a new funding formula for schools. \"The core schools budget has been protected in real terms since 2010 and is set to rise from \u00a341bn in 2017-18 to over \u00a342bn in 2019-20 with increasing pupil numbers,\" said a DFE spokeswoman. \"We have also consulted on a national funding formula for schools to make funding fairer.

Unlike any Police of other cities in India, Mumbai Police encompasses a Different system altogether. Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Outlay with real life approach of Mumbai Police Environment.<br \/><br \/>Amongst various Police officers & colleagues, the film describes the story of Anand Velankar, a young hot-blooded Cop coming from a poor family. His father is a harsh Police Constable. Anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies & incidences of his father's Atrocities on his mother. Anand's approach towards immediate action against crime, is an inert craving for his own Job satisfaction. The film is here revolved in a Plot wherein Anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors.This leads to frustrations, as he cannot achieve the desired Job-satisfaction. Resulting from the frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars, also turning him to an alcoholic.<br \/><br \/>The Spirit within him is still alive, as he constantly fights the system. He is aware of the system of the Metro, where the Police & Politicians are a inertly associated by far end. His compromise towards unethical practice is negative. Finally he gets suspended.<br \/><br \/>The Direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks in the Underworld gangster Rama Shetty's house to arrest him, followed by short conversation which is fantastic. At many scenes, the film has Hair-raising moments.<br \/><br \/>The Practical approach of Script is a major Punch.

Next, the search was refined to include only surveys explicitly designed to measure spiritual needs of patients or healthcare providers. In total, 45 surveys were identified and analyzed for content, validity, and reliability. The majority of surveys were found to have limited psychometric properties and were developed within specific religious traditions. However, a few surveys demonstrated good validity and reliability and were developed with a more inclusive approach to spirituality, such as the Spiritual Needs Assessment for Patients (SNAP) and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being (FACIT-Sp). The review concludes that more development and refinement of spiritual needs questionnaires are needed to better understand the relationship between spirituality and health outcomes.","prompt_len":375.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1199}

{"text":"Oxygen gas can also be produced through electrolysis of water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen. DC electricity must be used: if AC is used, the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2:1. Contrary to popular belief, the 2:1 ratio observed in the DC electrolysis of acidified water does not prove that the empirical formula of water is H2O unless certain assumptions are made about the molecular formulae of hydrogen and oxygen themselves.\n\nAs a general rule, the more oxygen in a molecule, the more effective it can become to form H2O while the lighter a molecule, the less effective it can be. A more oxygen-rich molecular formula is less easily oxidized, and a less oxygen-poor molecular formula is more sensitive to oxidation. In practice, it is relatively easy to create a more oxygen-rich molecular formula by adding hydrochloric acid to a solution of H2O; for example, the solution that the Romans called Aqueducts of Rome is usually understood in chemistry as being composed of hydrochloric acid dissolved in potassium hydroxide. Another technique is catalytic converters, such as the one in the hydrogenation unit at the Chernobyl power station now known as the Reactor 4, that oxidize H2O molecules to CO.\n\nAs the hydrogen becomes oxidized in the circuit, it generates water vapor. This vapor is fed into a condenser that separates the heat transferred to the reactor from the water vapor that is produced. As the water becomes oxygenated, it starts a cascade reaction: the process of generating carbon dioxide through oxidation is reversed, and the heat to run the reactor is used to generate water vapor. This cycle is repeated with hydrogen and oxygen gas in different amounts until the desired amount of electricity is produced.\n\nIn the Chernobyl plant, each unit has four converters, each of which produces hydrogen and two electrolytic converters","prompt_len":474.0,"label":"gpt2","text_length":1897}

{"text":"Arguably the finest serial ever made(no argument here thus far) about Earthman Flash Gordon, Professor Zarkov, and beautiful Dale Arden traveling in a rocket ship to another universe to save the planet. Along the way, in spellbinding, spectacular, and action-packed chapters Flash and his friends along with new found friends such as Prince Barin, Prince Thun, and the awesome King Vultan pool their resources together to fight the evils and armies of the merciless Ming of Mongo and the jealous treachery of his daughter Priness Aura(now she's a car!). This serial is not just a cut above most serials in terms of plot, acting, and budget - it is miles ahead in these areas. The first five chapters are absolutely phenomenal, in which the characters and story develop as the tale goes on. From the opening, a young and very young Flash is introduced: a young and immature Flash, he is almost too fast-moving, too fast-thinking, too quick to anger, too quick to laugh, too funny to mourn, too fast-running to lose, too fast-thinking to be slow. The same basic premise is repeated several times over throughout, but for the most part it's the way it unfolds that makes it so engaging and entertaining. Flash and his friends don't know any of their future selves, and so the novel is divided into two distinct halves: the first is the journey of the five together from the Earth to where they are heading, and the second half is the adventure of the five selves, or \"flashbacks,\" as the five present themselves to each other as they meet and then rejoin with those they had left behind on Earth. In these chapters the characters are joined by a young Dale Arden, who, despite having no knowledge of it at all, becomes a crucial member of the team. They get used to their new environment, learn their new skills at making music, learn some of the languages they may need to survive, and it seems that nothing is the same to them after their return. And then there is Flash himself. In the present day Flash is a young, ambitious, often brilliant man who is the captain of the ship his father has used to go to another Earth.

In theory, this is because TFEU article 288 says Directives are addressed to the member states and usually \"leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods\" to implement. In part this reflects that directives often create minimum standards, leaving member states to apply higher standards. For example, the Working Time Directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year, but most member states require more than 28 days in national law. However, on the current position adopted by the Court of Justice, citizens have standing to make claims based on national laws that implement Directives, but not from Directives themselves. Directives do not have so called \"horizontal\" direct effect (i.e. between non-state parties).

Cash flow problems exist when the present amount of funding cannot cover the current costs for labour and materials, and because they are a matter of having sufficient funds at a specific time, can arise even when the overall total is enough. These problems can happen particularly with public projects, where the availability of funds varies considerably across the country.\n\nHowever, while public projects will not necessarily fail to meet their costs, the risk of failure rises dramatically in public-private partnerships (PPPs). Under PPPs, the public sector, in general, pays for the project. However for some public projects, the private sector will have to be involved, to provide the infrastructure and management services, for example, water and sewerage. PPPs also have greater risks associated with them with regard to project delivery and financing, and have less flexibility for financing, as the Government will still have to meet its financial obligations.\n\nPublic borrowing is also a risk for government's fiscal performance when it exceeds target spending, because the interest rate paid on the debt is based on the government's financial position.

They have rather unusual properties and are even expected to be identical with their own antiparticles. So far this property is, however, not experimentally verified. Now scientists of the GERDA collaboration obtained new strong limits for the so-called neutrino-less double beta decay, which tests if neutrinos are their own antiparticles. The result rules out an earlier claim.This model of the GERDA experiment shows the onion-like structure which suppresses interfering signals from the environment.

The germanium diodes in the center of the cryostat filled with liquid argon (\u2013186\u00b0C) are to a larger scale. \u00a9 MPI for Nuclear PhysicsBesides photons, neutrinos are the most abundant particles in the Universe. They are often called `ghost particles', because they interact extremely weakly with matter. They are therefore an invisible, but very important component of the Universe, which could carry altogether as much mass as all other known forms of matter, albeit traveling almost at the speed of light over fantastic distances.Their tiny masses have also important consequences for the structures in the Universe and they are the driving element in the explosion of Supernovae. But their most remarkable and important property has been proposed by Ettore Majorana in the 1930ies: Unlike all other particles that form the known matter around us, neutrinos may be their own antiparticles.Particle and antiparticle are distinguished by their charges. The positron, for example, the antiparticle of the negatively charged electron, is positively charged. The neutrino, on the other hand, is electrically neutral \u2013 the prerequisite for the ability of being its own antiparticle. If this is really the case is being investigated by the GERDA experiment (GERmanium Detector Array) which is being carried out in the underground laboratories of the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso of the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare in Italy. In addition, the researchers want to determine the mass of neutrinos. To this end, GERDA examines so-called double beta decay processes in the germanium isotope Ge-76 with and without emissions of neutrinos \u2013 the latter being a consequence of the Majorana properties.In normal beta decay, a neutron inside a nucleus decays to a proton, an electron and an antineutrino. For nuclei like Ge-76, normal beta decay is energetically forbidden, but the simultaneous conversion of two neutrons with the emission of two antineutrinos is possible and has been measured by GERDA recently with unprecedented precision. This is one of the rarest decays ever observed with a half-life of about 2*1021 years, which is about 100 billion times longer than the age of the Universe.If neutrinos are Majorana particles, neutrino-less double beta decay should also occur at an even lower rate.

Julian Rome, a former SETI-worker, is brought in to decipher the message. The crew finds that the object is emitting some kind of weird electromagnetic radiation. Roman and his team uncover some kind of ancient civilization from the past who were building \"artifacts\". An explosion occurs on the Antarctic ice. With little explanation of what exactly happened and what was found, the crew returns to Earth believing that the mission was a complete failure... but when it is discovered that Earth has been destroyed, the crew's mission is now in chaos.\n\nPlot Edit\n\nThe movie follows the Antarctic expeditions that first made the discovery of an unexplained substance in Antarctica, in the year 2007. Soon after the discovery, they call for a second expedition to dig it out with the objective of studying it more. But when it is found again, there is no sign of any radioactivity.\n\nThe expedition arrives to the dig site with no idea that this may be a dig site, but after the team reaches a tunnel, they find that they are about to go down to the ice, but a radio signal suddenly goes in and out.

The better-than-expected performance lifted the firm's shares by 4.6% VW admitted last year to installing illegal software disguising the level of emissions from its diesel cars. The so called \"defeat devices\", which deactivated pollution controls, were placed in 11 million cars worldwide. Europe's biggest car manufacturer said it had seen an improvement in European car markets and the return of orders from corporate fleets. \"The operating result for the Volkswagen group before special items is significantly higher than market expectations for the first half of 2016,\" VW  said in a statement. The \u20ac2.2bn charge relates mainly \"to further legal risks predominately arising in North America,\" the company said. VW has already set aside \u20ac16.2bn to pay for technical upgrades for cars that break clean air standards, buying back cars, and legal costs. And it says it still expects 2016 sales revenue to fall by up to 5% compared to 2015. On Tuesday three US states - New York, Massachusetts and Maryland - said they had taken legal action against VW in the wake of the carmaker's emissions scandal. New York's Attorney-General called the use of \"defeat devices\" a \"widespread conspiracy\" and a \"cunningly cynical fraud\". \"It is regrettable that some states have decided to sue for environmental claims now, notwithstanding their prior support of this ongoing federal-state collaborative process,\" VW said. Last month, the carmaker announced a $15.3bn (\u00a311.6bn) settlement with federal regulators, several states and thousands of owners of the affected vehicles. That deal included a \"partial settlement\" with New York and 43 other states worth $603m. Last week, British MPs said that Volkswagen's failure to compensate UK owners of cars affected by the emissions scandal was \"deeply unfair\".

{"text":"The Hepatitis C Trust has taken \u00a3200,000 in grant funding from US drugs giant Gilead since 2014. Last year, it unsuccessfully took NHS England to court for restricting access to the medicine on cost grounds. The charity denied being influenced by the drugs industry. It said it had always acted in the interests of patients. In 2016, the Hepatitis C Trust brought a High Court action against NHS England to try to force it to reconsider a controversial decision to limit, or \"ration\", a new cure for hepatitis C. The new range of pills, which has completely changed the way hepatitis C is treated, is thought to be 95% effective at curing the disease within eight weeks. Before this, it could only be cured with a year of injections, often with damaging side-effects likened to those of chemotherapy. The first of these new drugs, Sovaldi - manufactured by Gilead - has a list price of \u00a334,983 for a 12-week course, although a confidential deal with NHS England will have reduced the final cost to the health service. In 2015, the health watchdog NICE ruled it was cost-effective compared with older medicines. NHS England set aside an extra \u00a3200m a year to pay for Sovaldi and other new hepatitis C treatments. But in 2016, faced with the high price of the new pills, it decided to limit the drug to 10,000 people a year, rising to 15,000 by 2021. An estimated 215,000 people in the UK are infected with hepatitis C, a virus that can cause liver damage and cancer. Access is not restricted in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. In the charity's case against the NHS, Gilead - along with rival drugs-makers Bristol-Myers Squibb and AbbVie - were listed as \"interested parties\" to the court case, according to documents seen by the BBC. An analysis of the charity's accounts shows it has longstanding financial links with drugs manufacturer Gilead, and other pharmaceutical companies developing new cures for hepatitis C. In 2016, the Trust accepted a total of \u00a3334,700 from five large pharmaceutical companies - 35% of its total income. For the financial year ending March 2016, it listed a \u00a3108,825 grant from Gilead. This level of drug industry funding appears to be significantly higher than most other charities and patient groups working in areas of the health service. Some refuse to accept any funding whatsoever from pharmaceutical companies. Watch video journalist Jim Reed's full report into hepatitis C drugs on the Victoria Derbyshire website. In September 2016, the charity lost its case. Mr Justice Blake ruled that the limit was \"not an arbitrary cap\", but a way of treating the most serious cases first. In his ruling, the judge suggested the drugs companies themselves might have been funding the legal action. Charles Gore, the chief executive of the Hepatitis C Trust, strongly denied this, and said the court case was publicly crowdfunded. \"We were doing this for patients. The fact that drug companies stood to benefit from it was neither here nor there,\" he said. \"We mustn't be in the pockets of big pharma [pharmaceutical companies], or seen to be in the pockets of big pharma. \"The NHS tries to influence us, the drugs industry tries to influence us, lots of people try to influence us. But it comes back to the same thing - what's right for patients?\" Other charities have been critical of patient groups that take large donations from drug companies working in the same area. Nick Harvey from Doctors of the World UK, which campaigns for greater access to hepatitis C drugs, describes this trend as \"very worrying\". \"Invariably the charities focus on the NHS for not allowing medicines to be given to them, and the blame goes towards the NHS. \"Hardly any of the debate is about the pharmaceutical industry and how much the medicine costs in the first place.\" One expert, Dr Andrew Hill - from the University of Liverpool - claims the drugs firm is making \"vast profits here, tens of billions of dollars\". Gilead said any support it provides to patient organisations is given \"transparently, in accordance with industry standards and all applicable regulations\". In a statement the company added: \"Our hepatitis C treatments offer value for money, as independently assessed by NICE.\" \"Curing patients both prevents onward transmission of this infectious disease [and] greatly reduces the financial burden to the NHS.\" An NHS England spokesman said \"by focusing on the sickest patients [with the new oral treatments] we've reduced mortality from hepatitis C by over 10% in the space of just one year\".

Carroll and her late husband exercised \"actual, open, notorious, hostile, continuous, and exclusive\" use of four lots off Amy Hart Path for more than 10 years as required under state adverse possession law.That means, under state Supreme Court precedent, the land is hers because Carroll's taking of the land was aggressive and out in the open for all to see. Any reasonable property owner would have been on notice that Carroll was moving to take the land as her own.The decision leaves Lisa and Michael Rodriques and Priscilla and Mark Estes out of luck, as owners of the property at issue. A lawyer in 2009 determined that the Esteses and Rodriqueses were the actual owners of the land, but didn't realize it due to misreading the property description by the town and others.\"It was a mistake in the reading of the property description,\" Christopher Anderson, Carroll's lawyer, said. He faulted the Rodriqueses and Esteses, who own land to the south of the properties in question, for not moving to pay taxes on the land once the error was unearthed.\"They were happy to have my client keep paying property taxes,\" Anderson said. He praised the Carrolls, too, for returning the land to the tax rolls.\"Actually ... it's consistent with the purpose of adverse possession,\" whose original purpose is to return land to productivity, he said.\"I'm disappointed in the decision,\" Carolyn Estes, of Montana, said. \"It is now in the hands of the lawyers.\" An appeal is being considered.If Van Couyghen's ruling stands, it would clear the title to the property in question and free Carroll to sell the lots.According to the ruling, Carroll's late husband, Francis, made a hobby in the mid-1980s of searching land evidence records and the tax rolls for properties missing from the tax rolls and without an apparent owner. After identifying such a lot, Carroll would deed the property from himself to himself and his wife. The tax assessor would be notified of the new deed and assess taxes to the land. The Carrolls then began paying taxes on the property and treating it as their own. Little Compton land records show Karen Carroll as owning eight properties.Francis Carroll's interest in Amy Hart Path began when he received a lot in the area after his parents' divorce. While researching his lot, he discovered that other nearby lots were missing from the tax rolls, meaning no taxes were being paid on them.

Empirical assessments of these impacts are difficult, however, because killer whales are sparsely distributed, highly mobile, and difficult to observe. We present a 4 yr time series of observations of foraging and feeding behavior of >150 transient killer whales that aggregate annually during the northbound migration of gray whales past Unimak Island, Alaska. Most predatory attacks were on gray whale Eschrichtius robustus calves or yearlings and were quickly abandoned if calves were aggressively defended by their mothers. Attacks were conducted by groups of 3 to 4 killer whales, which attempted to drown their prey. Gray whales generally tried to move into shallow water along the shoreline when attacked; if they succeeded in reaching depths of 3 m or less, attacks were abandoned. Kills occurred in waters from 15 to 75 m deep or were moved into such areas after death. After some hours of feeding, the carcasses were usually left, but were re-visited and fed on by killer whales over several days. Carcasses or pieces of prey that floated onshore were actively consumed by brown bears Ursus arctos, and carcasses on the bottom were fed on by sleeper sharks Somniosus pacificus, apparently increasing the local density of both species.KEY WORDS: Foraging strategy \u00b7 Predatory behavior \u00b7 Prey catching \u00b7 Scavenger \u00b7 Killer whale \u00b7 Gray whale \u00b7 Brown bear \u00b7 Sleeper shark","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":2678}

{"text":"At the same time the Mongols imported Central Asian Muslims to serve as administrators in China, the Mongols also sent Han Chinese and Khitans from China to serve as administrators over the Muslim population in Bukhara in Central Asia, using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands. This policy of using foreigners as administrators created tension and resentment among the local populations. The imported Central Asian Muslims in China often clashed with the local Chinese, who resented being ruled by foreigners. Similarly, the Han Chinese and Khitans sent to Central Asia were resented by the Muslim population, who saw them as outsiders imposing Mongol rule. \n\nThis tension was compounded by the fact that the Mongols often favored their own people over the locals, leading to corruption and abuse of power among the administrators. The resentment and mistrust generated by these policies made it difficult for the Mongols to maintain their grip on power in these regions and contributed to their eventual downfall.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Mongol Empire thrived for several centuries, and its legacy can still be seen today in the cultures and societies of the regions it once controlled.

In recent years, researchers have been trying to understand the various phenomena taking place in the sun. They have discovered that the sun's magnetic field is intricately linked to many of these phenomena such as sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections. They have also found that the sun's magnetic field has a profound effect on the space weather around our planet.\n\nUnderstanding the intricacies of the sun's magnetic field is essential in predicting space weather and its potential effects on Earth. It can help us prepare for potential natural disasters such as geomagnetic storms and power outages.\n\nMoreover, recent studies have shown that fluctuations in the sun's output could have a significant impact on the Earth's climate. Changes in solar irradiance, for example, could lead to variations in the Earth's temperature and rainfall patterns.

{"text":"While the fevered dreams of some on the right (and left) that Mrs Clinton would be frog-marched from campaign stage to jail cell have been dashed, the presumptive Democratic nominee's political pain is far from over. But how bad is it, exactly? Here are some reasons why it could be a grievous wound - or nothing but a scratch. Explanations dismantled. Mrs Clinton had a carefully constructed series of justifications and defences for her email decisions while secretary of state. James Comey's unusual press conference exploded like a torpedo beneath the water line, sinking those efforts. Mrs Clinton said she hadn't sent classified information. The FBI found more than 100 of her 30,000 emails (0.3%) contained details that were classified \"at the time\" they were transmitted and \"a very small number\" had markings \"indicating the presence of classified information\". She also said she had turned over all her work-related messages, but in fact her lawyers relied on keyword searches to sort through the email files and consequently missed several thousand relevant documents. Major media fact-checkers were quick to survey the scope of the damage. Politifact said the FBI \"clearly undercuts Clinton's defence\". The Washington Post upgraded its verdict on the veracity of Mrs Clinton's classified information claims from two to four \"Pinocchios\". The Associated Press wrote that the FBI \"left much of her account in tatters and may have aggravated questions of trust swirling around her Democratic presidential candidacy\". Polls show that many voters give Mrs Clinton low marks for veracity and openness - and these latest revelations will do nothing to help change this view. It's a lead weight holding her overall approval ratings down when she needs to be generating enthusiasm and energy for her general election campaign. Strength undermined. The Clinton team has framed much of its campaign as a contrast with Donald Trump, whom they are painting as a reckless and dangerous commander-in-chief. The former secretary of state, they counter, is tested and competent - a steady hand on the wheel in troubled times. But are steady hands labelled \"extremely careless\" with classified information by the FBI? Do they leave their personal communications open to possible \"hostile actors\", including sending emails on an unclassified system while \"in the territory of sophisticated adversaries\"? On Tuesday afternoon the Trump campaign sent a press release leading with the charge that Mrs Clinton \"compromised the safety of the American people\". \"Our adversaries almost certainly have a blackmail file on Hillary Clinton,\" he wrote, \"and that fact alone disqualifies her from service\". While there's no tangible support for that particular piece of Trump bluster, if the public doesn't buy Mrs Clinton's argument that she's the \"safe\" choice, much of the advantage she has on her sometimes intemperate opponent will disappear. More from the BBC Full election coverage Brexit lessons for Hillary Clinton Why aren't we more excited about Clinton? The establishment indicted. It has been a common theme in the presidential campaigns of Mr Trump on the right and Bernie Sanders on the left that establishment insiders live under their own set of rules. While average Americans are left to their fate, big bankers get bailouts, big businesses get handouts, and the elite are insulated from the consequences of their actions. For those with this outlook, the failure to indict Hillary Clinton - or even hold her accountable in a non-criminal manner - is yet another example of the benefits that come along with high positions of power. While Comey insisted that there was little precedent for a prosecution given that Mrs Clinton did not intentionally mishandle classified information or do so in a \"grossly negligent\" way, such explanations may not fly with the swath of voters currently alienated from the political process. In 1997 then-Vice-President Al Gore gave a press conference in which he said there was \"no controlling legal authority\" capable of ruling on whether his fund-raising activities violated federal law. Although Mr Gore never stood accused of a crime, Republican George W Bush used his legalistic word-play to paint him as above the law again and again when the two squared off for the presidency in 2000. Mr Gore was the Democratic heir apparent running to succeed a still-popular two-term president. He lost. A trusted face. FBI Director Comey's just-the-facts delivery on Tuesday made the findings he presented all the more damaging to the Clinton campaign. The charge that the former secretary of state was \"extremely careless\" would not have nearly the same impact if it came from a Republican politician. In fact, many conservatives have tried tagging Mrs Clinton with much, much worse. Instead the man delivering the very public rebuke is a career law enforcement official with a sterling reputation for rectitude and probity. Videos of Comey's statement have already found their way into a Republican attack advert - with many more sure to come. And on Thursday Republicans in Congress will have the opportunity to elicit more potentially damaging sound bites from the FBI director when they call him to testify on his findings and the decision not to recommend criminal charges. Most Americans may not have known who James Comey was before Tuesday, but chances are they're going to be seeing a lot of his face as the general election campaign heats up. She wasn't indicted. If the news for Mrs Clinton on Tuesday was bad, it could have been much, much worse. When Comey approached the lectern, the Democratic candidate's staff had no idea what he would say. Would Mrs Clinton or some of her staff face charges? While she wouldn't have been the first candidate even in this election cycle to run for president while under indictment, it still would have been a devastating blow to her campaign. Democrats would clamour for another candidate - possibly Mr Sanders or even Vice-President Joe Biden - to be nominated at their convention in three weeks. Instead the fallout from the FBI investigation will be political, not criminal. Political damage control is something the Clintons know how to do. It's something they've been doing in the national spotlight for more than 25 years. Shortly after Comey delivered his stern rebuke, the Clinton campaign was already trying to turn the page. \"We are pleased that the career officials handling this case have determined that no further action by the department is appropriate,\" spokesman Brian Fallon said. With indictment off the table, one of the possible \"wild cards\" that could have thrown the race into chaos has been removed from the deck. While the former secretary of state's reputation has been further damaged, the electoral advantages she - and the Democrats - have heading in to the general election are still intact. Trump will overplay his hand. Often when Mrs Clinton seems to be in trouble, Donald Trump sweeps in with some news-cycle grabbing statement or action that spares her from the full force of the blow. His post-Orlando-shooting speech that criticised Muslims in the US was widely panned, and his boasts about how the UK Brexit vote would help his campaign while on Scottish soil sparked anger on both sides of the Atlantic. Such missteps have been so pronounced at times that it's given rise to conspiracy theories that Mr Trump is actually a secret Democratic operative intent on electing Mrs Clinton and destroying the Republican Party from within. Such paranoid fantasies were dusted off once again on Tuesday evening as Mr Trump made remarks during an off-the-cuff speech that put him squarely back in the spotlight. While he started by re-enforcing the themes he had laid out in his press releases earlier in the day - that Mrs Clinton's email actions showed a dangerous lack of regard for US security - he soon lost focus. He accused Attorney General Loretta Lynch of accepting a bribe in exchange for refusing to charge Mrs Clinton - an explosive accusation for a party standard-bearer to make, particularly given that Comey said he had not consulted with Lynch prior to issuing his report. Then he offered praise for former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who he said was a \"bad man\" - but one who was effective at killing terrorists. While it was a line that Mr Trump had used in the past, it came when the media and fellow Republicans believed he should have been hammering Mrs Clinton on emails and nothing but emails. Instead, the Clinton camp was able to fire off a release condemning Mr Trump's Hussein comments. Republican leaders like House Speaker Paul Ryan were forced to defend - or renounce - their presumptive nominee's remarks. What should have been a poisonous news cycle for Mrs Clinton became a little less so thanks to Mr Trump. Republicans will move on. While there was plenty of grousing among Republican politicians following Comey's announcement of no charges on Tuesday, the response was far from full-throated outrage. Several congressional Republicans have called for an independent counsel within the Justice Department to investigate the matter further, but so far the move doesn't seem to be gaining much traction. A free-ranging independent investigation could pose a significant risk to the Clinton campaign, heralding a new string of testimonies and subpoenas that would keep the matter in the news and leave open the possibility of perjury or obstruction of justice. Instead, it seems, the House of Representatives will hold hearings looking into the decision not to indict, giving Republicans plenty of opportunity to grandstand - or come across as showboats. There could be a move to formally censure Mrs Clinton - although Congress has few working days to act before its members head to the conventions and hit the campaign trail in earnest. House Speaker Ryan has also suggested cutting off Mrs Clinton's access to the security briefings given to presidential candidates. Such a development would be embarrassing, but it's unclear how Congress could force the executive-branch national security agencies that deliver the briefings to take such a step. It's still early. If the Clinton camp could pick the best time for the FBI director to deliver a stern rebuke of Mrs Clinton, they probably would opt for right now, in the early July space between the end of the presidential primary season and the Democratic convention. Voters won't weigh in on Mrs Clinton for another four months, giving the campaign plenty of time to recover. In just over three weeks Mrs Clinton will take the stage in Philadelphia to accept her party's nomination, culminating days of positive press as major party stars - from President Barack Obama to Vice-President Joe Biden to Senator Elizabeth Warren to Bill Clinton - sing her praises. On Tuesday night, just hours after the FBI announcement, Mr Obama was on stage with Mrs Clinton, showing just how enthusiastic he's going to be on the campaign trail for her. Even by next week political wags and pundits will be back to speculating about vice-presidential picks and the possible craziness in store at the Trump-led Republican convention. Mrs Clinton's email imbroglio will cast its shadow on the campaign, but barring any new, explosive revelations - it's likely a wound that time can heal.

The moderate revolutionary Danton has returned to Paris from his country seat where he has been since being deposed as leader of the Committee of Public Safety in the previous year by Robespierre. He is opposed to \"\"The Reign Of Terror\"\" which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens, mainly by guillotine, who are thought to be opposed to the Revolution. Danton and Robespierre find themselves in conflict with the new revolutionary government and are led into a trap on Mont-Saint-Michel, with the police and army of Paris at their heels.

{"text":"That's what Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in's Martin McGuinness wants, and both the SDLP and Alliance are prepared to give the idea a fair wind. But unionists - who have until now blocked the introduction of same-sex marriage in a series of Northern Ireland Assembly votes - are not impressed. Both the DUP's Nigel Dodds and the UUP's Danny Kennedy indicated they would reject the move in a UTV election debate. Supporters of change point to surveys suggesting the majority of people in Northern Ireland approve of same-sex marriage as evidence that MLAs are out of touch with public opinion. But the problem with the referendum suggestion is that it is far from clear how such a poll might be called. Referenda tend to be much less frequent in the UK than in the Republic of Ireland. Although the 1998 Northern Ireland Act enables a Northern Ireland secretary of state to call a border poll in certain circumstances, nothing in it confers upon the assembly or the Northern Ireland Executive the right to hold a referendum of their own. If the assembly passed a motion calling on the Westminster government to hold a referendum, that might lead to London ministers passing the relevant legislation. Alternatively, Westminster could give Stormont the necessary authority to legislate for a referendum itself - which would be similar to what happened in Scotland in relation to last year's independence vote. But both those scenarios would depend on there being a consensus at Stormont - something that does not exist, if the assembly's four same-sex marriage votes are anything to go by.  Indeed in the wake of Mr McGuinness's latest call, the Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt has wondered - perhaps tongue in cheek - whether similar referenda should be held on issues like abortion, euthanasia and the death penalty. It is impossible to imagine London ministers pressing ahead in the knowledge that a majority of unionists are vehemently opposed to holding a poll. Not all supporters of same-sex marriage think a referendum is a good idea. The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGTB) support organisation, the Rainbow Project, argues that even if the public voted in favour of same-sex marriage the assembly might not regard it as binding. The Rainbow Project is backing a court case brought by a gay couple married elsewhere in the UK who are seeking a declaration that they remain legally married in Northern Ireland. The case is due to be heard again in November 2015. So the courts may have their say on the current patchwork of marriage laws before any referendum becomes a reality. But if the convoluted history of cases like the ban on blood donations from gay men is anything to go by, then don't expect a clear answer from m'learned friends any time soon.

The franchise all-time leading scorer who ranked third in NBA annals in career points when he retired in 1978 was one of the handful of best all-around players in hoop history, and played at a high level longer than anyone not named Jabbar, Stockton or Malone.Along with Scottie Pippen and Michael Cooper, John was the most versatile defender in NBA history. An athletic 6-5 swingman considered by many to be the best all-around athlete in pro sports during the early 1970's, he was a fine shooter and passer, and one of the greatest clutch players ever at both ends of the floor in league annals.\"Hondo\" saw the floor extremely well, and was a good enough ballhandler to often swing to the backcourt and run an offense, as he did for much of the 1976 NBA Finals. He was also a good rebounder for his size, averaging as many as nine rebounds a game, and rarely missed a blockout.John was old school fundamentals and toughness melded with new school athleticism. Almost every sport he tried, he excelled at. But he chose basketball when he could have been a pro in at least four sports. He was a superb finisher in transition at a time when teams ran the fast break constantly, none better than Boston, but he rarely dunked or did anything flashy except when absolutely necessary. He operated extremely well with an economy of motion.When dribbling he often ran with quick, short choppy strides, which allowed him to change direction in the blink of an eye. Away from the ball, he sprinted with excellent speed, always moving, cutting, looking for an opening. The older he got, the better and more confident he became as a shooter. On defense, he shuffled his feet quickly and superbly, and kept his nose on the ball in textbook fashion, never giving up.Along with John Stockton, he was the best-conditioned player and most indefatigable runner in NBA history. No player moved as well without the ball or as constantly, as he ran his weary defenders into submission and finished them off with a series of runners, bank shots, pull-up jumpers and drives. In college, he was afraid to even drink one Coca-Cola for fear it would affect his incredible stamina negatively.Hall of Famer Pete Newell, the man who coached California to the 1959 NCAA title before losing to Ohio State and Hondo in the 1960 finals, went on to be general manager of the Lakers in the 1970's.

It's kind of like the Olive Garden - I like it, but I have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it.<br \/><br \/>I'm not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit. The trailers looked good, but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last Kevin Costner movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld. I also had a nagging feeling that this movie was going to be too predictable and clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, I decided to give it a chance and settled into my seat with a tub of buttered popcorn.\n\nAs the opening scenes unfolded, I found myself pleasantly surprised. The acting was solid, and the cinematography was stunning. I was drawn into the story of a retired Coast Guard rescue swimmer, played by actor Ashton Kutcher, who was haunted by a tragedy from his past that he hoped to make amends for by training a group of new recruits.\n\nDespite my initial doubts, I found myself fully engrossed in the plot and rooting for the characters. The movie may not have been groundbreaking, but it was well-executed and emotionally satisfying. By the time the credits rolled, I was glad I had given The Guardian a chance, despite my reservations.\n\nAs I stepped out of the theater and into the rainy night, I realized that sometimes it's worth breaking out of your comfort zone and trying something new - even if it's just a movie that you weren't initially excited about.

{"text":"I decided to watch this movie because I'd not seen Carol Lombard before in any movie. I'm sorry it had to be this one because, quite frankly, this is a dog \u0096 and even with Jimmy Stewart and Charles Coburn, both of whom were great actors.<br \/><br \/>The problem with the film is simple: it tries to put too much, too quickly, in to a story about a young lawyer (John Manson played by Stewart) who marries Jane (played by Lombard) within an hour of meeting her. What's that clich\u00e9? Marry in haste, repent at leisure... <br \/><br \/>In short, the story is a series of episodes that show the couples' worsening financial status, their troubles with John's live-in mother, their struggles to pay the bills, John's diminished status at the office, the arrival of their baby son, John Jnr (unexpected and causing additional friction at home with mother), the couples' angst about their marriage, the baby's sickness which worsens, thus necessitating an heroic flight by a lone pilot (in a fierce storm) to bring a special serum to save the child, and finally John being accepted as a junior partner at the law firm.<br \/><br \/>How many more clich\u00e9d situations could the writers include? Maybe Mother dying soon after? There wasn't much comedy; the drama was lacklustre, at best; the dialog was painful to hear. Only the acting of the four main players was adequate.<br \/><br \/>This was the period at the end of the Great Depression with the USA coming out of its long downturn \u0096 during which many people experienced all of the events portrayed in the movie.<br \/><br \/>So, it made sense for Selznick to reaffirm good ol' home spun American values of family, relationships, heroism, perseverance, and initiative \u0096 all against the backdrop of the \"\"average\"\" American family. Who better to use than Jimmy Stewart and Carol Lombard? <br \/><br \/>And, it should be noted that the film was released in early 1939; so, it was planned in 1938 \u0096 soon after the USA began to get production going for the coming World War II. Hence, this sort of film was a great booster for the general public, at that time, many of who would soon have to join England in war. As many here would know, Hollywood and Washington formed an uneasy alliance before, during and after the war.<br \/><br \/>However, I'm glad I saw it \u0096 as a piece of disguised socio-political propaganda. But, I'll have to see other Lombard films to gain a better appreciation of her acting range.<br \/><br \/>As another reviewer noted: see this one just to say that you've seen all of Stewart's movies; otherwise, don't bother.\"","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":2567}

{"text":"A two-year-old San Diego law credited with preventing boats and large campers from monopolizing parking spots, especially near the beach, became permanent legislation on Tuesday.City Council members unanimously approved eliminating a \"sunset clause\" from the oversized vehicle ordinance based on positive feedback from residents, community leaders and the Police Department.They say the law's positive impact on safety, aesthetics and parking availability trumps the hassles it has created for some local recreational vehicle owners who have had to begin paying for storage lots or using their yards.City officials estimate there are roughly 100,000 recreational vehicle owners in San Diego.Some community leaders have also expressed concerns that the ordinance has increased homelessness by forcing some people who had been sleeping in RVs onto the streets.The law, which would have expired in August without the council's vote to eliminate the sunset clause, primarily targets tourists with large campers who sleep inside their vehicles to avoid paying for hotels or other accommodations, particularly during summer months.This practice often means trash on the street, loitering outside the campers and other problems that turn some neighborhoods into makeshift campgrounds.The law also cracks down on people who use city streets to park their boats, non-motorized vehicles and other large vehicles.The law prohibits such vehicles from parking on any San Diego city street or in any public parking lot between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m., and makes it illegal to park those vehicles within 50 feet of any intersection at any time of the day.An oversized vehicle is defined as one more than 27 feet long and more than 7 feet tall.The law includes exemptions for school buses, some city vehicles and commercial vehicles making deliveries.The city has posted more than 300 red-and-white signs throughout San Diego explaining the new law, mostly near freeway exits.Residents say the problem became steadily worse in San Diego before the law was passed in August 2014, partly because most other cities along the coast had previously adopted similar bans.San Diego spent more than seven years crafting the new law, with the largest sticking point being whether it should apply citywide or only along the coast.Pacific Beach residents Lou Cumming praised the city for making the law permanent, predicting the problems would revive without it.\"These visual eyesores present safety hazards and health hazards and they reduce the quality of life in our residential neighborhoods,\" Cumming said.Other residents say they support the law, but complained that police need to step up enforcement.Some also say it's forced them to begin contacting city code compliance officers, because many RV owners are now illegally parking them in side and front yards.Lt. Adam Sharki said enforcement is handled by the city's 20 police investigative service officers, who are a step below full-blown police officers and make less money.The city plans to add three more such officers this summer, increasing their ability to issue citations in areas where oversized vehicles typically park, Sharki said.Since the law took effect, the city has issued 2,028 warnings and 3,190 citations, which come with a $100 fine.The number of fines for parking within 50 feet","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":3325}
{"text":"In the triplet form, O 2 molecules are paramagnetic. That is, they impart magnetic character to oxygen when it is in the presence of a magnetic field, because of the spin magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons in the molecule, and the negative exchange energy between neighboring O 2 molecules. Liquid oxygen is attracted to a magnet to a sufficient extent that, in laboratory demonstrations, a bridge of liquid oxygen may be supported against its own weight between the poles of a powerful magnet. When in contact with a magnet, there is an excess force due to the magnetic interaction of neighboring molecules that tends to squeeze the liquid O 2 into a thin film against the surface of the magnet [3]. This behavior is used in magnetometers, the measurement instruments that use O 2 to measure the magnetic field and that are used in fields such as geological exploration to locate oil and mineral deposits.

{"text":"In case you were wondering, there's no evidence that Mars hosted an alien civilization thousands of years ago.Nonetheless, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., asked a panel of planetary scientists to speculate about this possibility today (July 18), during a hearing of the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Science, Space and Technology's Space Subcommittee.The inquiry followed testimony by panelist Ken Farley, the project scientist for NASA's Mars 2020 rover mission, stating that the Red Planet had lakes and rivers, and perhaps even a huge northern ocean, until about 3.6 billion years ago. So it fell to Farley to answer the question of whether Mars was perhaps once home to intelligent aliens. [13 Ways to Hunt Intelligent Aliens]\"So, the evidence is that Mars was different billions of years ago, not thousands of years ago, and there is no evidence I'm aware of that \u2014 \" Farley began.\"Would you rule that out?\"' Rohrabacher interjected.\"I would say that is extremely unlikely,\" Farley responded.The belief that intelligent aliens may call Mars home has a rich and eventful history. For example, more than a century ago, American astronomer Percival Lowell claimed to have spotted canals on Mars, which he hypothesized had been built to bring water from the planet's polar ice caps down to the midlatitudes.And in 1976, photos by NASA's Viking 1 Mars orbiter showed a landform that bore a striking resemblance to a human face. Though clearer imagery by later spacecraft revealed the \"Face on Mars\" to be an ordinary rock formation, some people still claim that it's evidence of an ancient civilization.Many orbiters, landers and rovers have explored Mars over the decades, and none have detected any evidence that intelligent organisms ever arose there. But that doesn't necessarily mean the Red Planet has never supported life of any kind.As Farley noted, observations by NASA's Curiosity rover and a number of other spacecraft suggest that at least some parts of the Red Planet were habitable for long stretches in the distant past. So ancient Mars may have hosted microbial life, many scientists say; indeed, some researchers think microbes may survive there today, buried deep in the soil, where they're protected from the high radiation fluxes on the surface. (Among this latter group is Gil Levin, the leader of the labeled-release experiment on the Viking Mars landers. He still believes this experiment found solid evidence of microbial metabolism in the Martian soil, though most other researchers view the results as equivocal.)The 2020 Mars rover will search for evidence of past (not current) microbial life when it arrives at the Red Planet in February 2021. The six-wheeled robot, which is based heavily on Curiosity's design, will also collect and store samples for possible future return to Earth.\"Truly definitive discovery of microbial biosignatures by instruments on board the rover is unlikely, and can best be undertaken by using the full arsenal of terrestrial laboratories,\" Farley testified at the hearing today, explaining the rationale behind the sample-caching strategy.

{"text":"conventional radiation therapy ( rt ) is a widely recognized treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) . however , conventional rt plays only a limited role in hcc treatment because of its low efficacy and the low tolerance of the liver for this modality . to address this, a new therapeutic strategy has been introduced under the name of \"ultrasound radiation medicine.\" ( utero radiation therapy or URT ).\n\n\nOverview and Clinical Applications\n\nThe primary goal of URT is to lower liver damage by increasing the amount of therapeutic neutrophils in the liver following acute inflammation. These neutrophils (as shown in Figure 1) will target the metastatic tumor, and remove the liver tumor cells. To do so, they will be driven by a special protein, a neutrophil-specific chemokine called IFN-gamma [22, 23]. These neutrophils also act to reduce the release of inflammation-induced cytokines (IgA, IL-2, MIP-1\u03b2) [22, 23]. When IFN-gamma is present in the blood, IL-2 release in the neutrophil-treated hcc cells will be decreased [24]. This is important because the levels of these cytokines in the blood are increased following infection with hepatotoxic viruses like hepatitis C and HCC. Without this IFN-gamma reduction, these cytokines could be triggered prematurely, resulting in damage to the liver.\n\nPursuant to these promising findings, there has been a long-standing interest in the use of neutrophil-based chemotherapy in hcc clinical trials. In 2007, the Canadian Paediatric Society and the Canadian Society for Radiation Oncology launched a joint program aimed at developing an immunotherapy for children with advanced hcc.

Many of his cruel experiments were conducted on young twins.Notorious Doctor of AuschwitzMengele, the notorious doctor of Auschwitz, has become an enigma of the 20th century. Mengele's handsome physical appearance, fastidious dress, and calm demeanor seemingly contradicted his attraction to murder and gruesome experiments.Mengele's seeming omnipresence at the railroad unloading platform called the ramp, as well as his fascination with twins, incited images of a mad, evil monster. His ability to elude capture increased his notoriety as well as gave him a mystical and devious persona.In May 1943, Mengele entered Auschwitz as an educated, experienced, medical researcher. With funding for his experiments, he worked alongside some of the top medical researchers of the time.Anxious to make a name for himself, Mengele searched for the secrets of heredity. The Nazi ideal of the future would benefit from the help of genetics, according to Nazi doctrine. If so-called Aryan women could assuredly give birth to twins who were sure to be blond and blue-eyed, the future could be saved.Mengele, who worked for Professor Otmar Freiherr von Vershuer, a biologist who pioneered twin methodology in the study of genetics, believed that twins held these secrets. Auschwitz seemed the best location for such research because of a large number of available twins to use as specimens.The RampMengele took his turn as the selector on the ramp, but unlike most of the other selectors, he arrived sober. With a small flick of his finger or riding crop, a person would either be sent to the left or to the right, to the gas chamber or to hard labor.Mengele would get very excited when he found twins. The other SS officers who helped unload the transports had been given special instructions to find twins, dwarfs, giants or anyone else with a unique hereditary trait like a club foot or heterochromia (each eye a different color).Mengele was on the ramp not only during his selection duty but also when it was not his turn as a selector to ensure twins would not be missed.As the unsuspecting people were herded off the train and ordered into separate lines, SS officers shouted in German, \"Zwillinge!\" (Twins!). Parents were forced to make a quick decision. Unsure of their situation, already being separated from family members when forced to form lines, seeing barbed wire, smelling an unfamiliar stench -- was it good or bad to be a twin?Sometimes parents announced they had twins, and in other cases relatives, friends, or neighbors made the statement. Some mothers tried to hide their twin, but the SS officers and Mengele searched through the surging ranks of people in search of twins and anyone with unusual traits.While many twins were either announced or discovered, some sets of twins were successfully hidden and walked with their mother into the gas chamber.About 3,000 twins were pulled from the masses on the ramp, most of them children; only around 200 survived.

The world champion started 10th and was hampered by a problem with an engine setting during the race. The world champion dropped to 24 points adrift of Rosberg in the championship as a result. Hamilton said he had an \"off day\" in qualifying and Mercedes were at a loss to understand what happened. But in the race it was different. After a cautious start, Hamilton began to make up ground, picking up positions until he was fourth, right behind Force India's Sergio Perez after 11 laps - helped by an early stop for Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. But Hamilton could not pass the slippery Force India and began to run into vibration problems from the tyres, which he had damaged in qualifying. Mercedes tried to pass Perez by stopping earlier but Force India thwarted them by bringing in the Mexican the next lap. After the pit stop, Hamilton tried to pass Perez again but then began to drop back. It emerged from communication between driver and team that there was a problem with an engine setting - but the team radio restrictions meant the team could not tell him what was wrong or how to fix it. It is not yet completely clear what had happened - although the team said it was \"a problem with the setting you are in\" but that \"it's not something you've done - it's a setting that is incorrect\". Hamilton was clearly frustrated but with 10 laps to go he finally made a change that solved the problem. He briefly set the fastest first sector time of the race, but then did not speed up and cruised slowly to the finish behind Perez. Both drivers had the same problem at times during the race. \"Nico had made a change during the race that caused the issue,\" said a Mercedes spokesperson. \"So when told it was an issue with the mode, as permitted by FIA, he switched back out of it. \"Lewis had the setting from start of race and it was not obvious that this setting was causing the problem. The fundamental problem is on our heads as it was a configuration not working properly, not the driver's fault. \"But the radio rules complicated things drastically: without this, it would have been solved immediately.\" The race was predicted to be a festival of drama, all the drivers believing there would be errors and resultant safety cars. But the drivers all kept the cars out of the barriers, and in an unexpectedly unexciting inaugural race on the streets of the Azerbaijani captial Baku, Rosberg was imperious and the battle was behind him. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel took a comfortable second, a position he grabbed by passing Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo on lap six. But any hope of a race for the lead was dashed immediately - Rosberg was a second a lap quicker throughout. Red Bull put Ricciardo on a two-stop strategy, with a very early first pit stop on lap six. Ferrari initially planned to follow suit - another dubious strategy decision after the criticisms of their decision to switch to a two-stop while leading in Canada a week ago. This time, Vettel questioned the team and after initially saying he had to stop because he was going to be under-cut by Ricciardo, they kept him out - stopping Raikkonen instead. It led to an easy second place for Vettel, while Raikkonen fought back past Force India's Nico Hulkenberg and Ricciardo. Vettel emerged behind Raikkonen after his single stop, but the Finn let him by as requested and in the closing laps found himself under pressure from Perez, who passed him with two laps to go to take the final podium position. It was a fitting reward after a strong weekend that was made harder by a crash in final practice that led to a gearbox change and a drop from second to seventh on the grid.

{"text":"in this paper we investigate the cosmological consequences of a continuous matter creation associated with the production of particles by the gravitational field acting on the quantum vacuum . to illustrate this ,  three phenomenological models are considered . an equivalent scalar field description is presented for each models . The first model proposes a constant creation rate of matter, while the second allows for a creation rate that decreases with time. The third model assumes a creation rate that increases with the cosmic scale factor. We find that in all three cases, the cosmological evolution differs significantly from the standard \u039bCDM model.\n\nUsing the equivalent scalar field description, we can study the behavior of the models in greater detail. In the first model, the scalar field plays no significant role, and the cosmological evolution is well described by a modified Friedmann equation. In the second model, the scalar field plays a more significant role, and the evolution of both the scale factor and the scalar field are coupled. Finally, in the third model, the scalar field dominates the evolution of the universe at late times, leading to a very different cosmic history.\n\nOur results suggest that continuous matter creation could provide an alternative explanation for the observed acceleration of the universe, without the need for dark energy. This opens up new avenues for exploration in cosmology and particle physics, and further investigations are needed to fully understand the implications of these models.","prompt_len":331.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1548}
{"text":"host genetic background is known as an important factor in patients ' susceptibility to infectious diseases such as viral hepatitis . the aim of this study was to determine the effect of genetic polymorphisms of interleukin-16 ( il-16 ) cytokine on susceptibility of hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) infected patients to develop chronic hbv infection . genotyping was conducted using pcr followed by enzymatic digestion and rflp ( restriction fragment length polymorphism ) analysis . The study found that the presence of specific genetic polymorphisms of the il-16 cytokine was significantly associated with increased susceptibility to chronic HBV infection. This suggests that the il-16 cytokine plays a role in the immune response to HBV, and that genetic variations in this cytokine may affect the ability of the host to mount an effective response against the virus. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying this association, and to identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention in chronic HBV infection. Overall, these findings highlight the value of studying host genetic factors in infectious diseases, and may have important implications for the development of personalized treatment approaches for patients with chronic HBV infection.","prompt_len":477.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1280}

{"text":"Staff had to wear formal business wear, arrive at 9am, use the titles Mr and Mrs, couldn't look at social media and weren't allowed to make personal calls. \"It was a horrible experience for everybody,\" says Sir Richard Branson, one of the UK's best-known and wealthiest entrepreneurs. The purpose of the exercise, he says, was to give its people \"a taste of what a lot of the world is still run like\". As founder of the firm, which has gone from a mail order record company to having businesses in telecoms, travel and financial services, Sir Richard himself has never followed a conventional path to business success. He left school at 16 and didn't go to university. And at the Virgin parent company, staff are able to work flexibly and take as much holiday as they like, for example. His belief is that making work a more pleasant place to be, by offering more flexibility; such as the ability to dress down, work from home or part-time, and take unpaid leave if they wish, will attract people and encourage them to stay and fulfil their potential. \"Hopefully that'll be the world of the future and that's something that we're working towards trying to get more flexibility in the workforce generally,\" he says. While there is no universally accepted definition, the term \"millennial\" is typically applied to those born between 1980 and 1999, the largest age group to emerge since the baby boom generation, and a group that accountancy firm Deloitte predicts will make up 75% of the global workforce by 2025. As a generation that came of age after the 2008 financial crisis and have never known a world without the internet, they have very different expectations about jobs and money. Several surveys suggest that these younger workers aren't motivated by the same factors as previous generations, such as a job for life, but instead value a good work life balance and a sense of purpose beyond financial success. It's a drastically different outlook from the generations before who are used to the more traditional hierarchy of large corporate firms - staying at the same firm and working a set number of years in a particular post before progressing. But as this group grows as a proportion of the workforce, employers will have to shift their working practices to attract and retain staff from this generation. Firms which get it right can create a competitive advantage in securing the best staff, says China Gorman, a HR executive with over 20 years' experience. \"No matter where in the world, no matter what industry, no matter the size of the company - trust is the foundation for creating a great workplace culture,\" she says. But she admits it doesn't come easily to many, particularly those more used to a hierarchical structure. \"For some in the baby boomer generation knowledge is power. \"They operate on a need-to-know basis and 'I'll tell you what you need to know'.\" Nathan Blecharczyk, co-founder of room sharing website Airbnb, which has over 2,000 employees, says in the technology arena in which they operate the competition for staff is very intense. In a bid to attract more millennials he says the firm makes it very clear what, its core values are to help make it stand out to would be employees. \"Millennials are known to be more purpose-driven, so as a company both internally and externally we're always communicating what our values are and trying to be true to those things,\" he says. Accordingly, the firm has weekly Friday meetings in each of its offices, then an all company meeting every fortnight that is streamed live to its 20 offices around the world where it talks about the most important things to the company. On top of this, it holds an annual three-day meeting in San Francisco where all employees are flown in so everyone can meet and communicate face-to-face. He says the firm has also worked on creating a relaxed office environment where staff feel as comfortable there as they do at home. \"We're constantly trying to remind our employees of what business we are in, in creating an environment where they can be totally comfortable and where they actually want to hang out after work,\" he says. Ryan Holmes, the founder of Hootsuite, which provides social media management tools, has also worked hard to avoid the traditional hierarchies of larger firms. Rather than having a layer of management which dictates to their team below, the firm has instead tried to give individual teams more power. It's also created a so called \"guru track\" to enable those in the company who don't want to become traditional leaders still achieve some kind of recognition. Instead of trying to ram a round peg into a square hole, \"[It's about] how can we help this person progress through their career as an amazing engineer, instead of the only track is to become a leader or a manager\". For companies adapting the way they work to millennials' strengths, is a direction which CEO coach Steve Tappin believes will be effective. \"If CEOs try and over control in the old way then millennials will walk but if you can harness their ideas, passion and energy then that's going to power the future success of the company,\" he says. This feature is based on interviews by CEO coach and author Steve Tappin for the BBC's CEO Guru series, produced by Neil Koenig. ","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":5288}

These networks are called Diophantine networks and their topology is determined by the number and arrangement of the variables and coefficients in the associated diophantine equation. The behaviour of these networks is closely related to the solutions of the corresponding diophantine equation, making them powerful tools for studying algebraic systems.\n\nDiophantine networks have a wide range of applications in fields such as cryptography, communication networks, and computational complexity theory. They are particularly useful in cryptography for designing secure public key encryption systems based on the hardness of solving diophantine equations.\n\nFurthermore, by studying the topological and algebraic properties of diophantine networks, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental structure and properties of algebraic systems. This has led to the development of new theoretical tools and techniques for studying complex systems in domains ranging from computer science and mathematics to physics and biology.\n\nIn conclusion, the association of networks with diophantine equations has led to the development of a new class of deterministic networks with powerful applications in various domains. The study of diophantine networks has opened up new avenues for understanding complex systems and provides a rich ground for future research in the field of network science.","prompt_len":160.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1559}

{"text":"Marcy Borders became known as the \"dust lady\" after a photo showed her covered in dust as she escaped the World Trade Center during the attacks. Ms Borders, a mother of two, died on Monday, her family said on Facebook. She blamed her cancer on inhaling dust during the attack and suffered from alcoholism and anxiety in later years. \"I can't believe my sister is gone,\" her brother Michael Borders wrote on Facebook. Her cousin John Borders called her a \"hero\" and said she had \"succumbed to the diseases that [had] ridden her body since 9\/11\". \"In addition to losing so many friends, co-workers and colleagues on and after that tragic day ... the pains from yesteryear have found a way to resurface,\" he added. On 11 September 2001, Ms Borders was just one month into a new job at Bank of America on the 81st floor of the north tower when the plane hit. \"The building started quaking and swaying. I lost all control, and I went into a frenzy. I fought my way out of that place,\" she told the Daily Mail in 2011. Defying instructions from her boss to stay put, she fled down the stairway and into the lobby of an adjacent building where she was photographed by Stan Honda. Mr Honda, a professional photographer, recalled the moment in a post on Facebook on the 10th anniversary of the attacks. \"A woman came in completely covered in grey dust. You could tell she was nicely dressed for work and for a second she stood in the lobby. I took one shot of her before the police officer started to direct people up a set of stairs, thinking it would be safer off the ground level.\" Ms Borders, who was from New Jersey, was not aware she had been photographed until her mother saw the image the following day and contacted Mr Honda. In the years after the attacks, as her picture became one of the most iconic images of the day, Ms Borders suffered from severe depression and drug addiction and lost custody of her two children. \"I didn't do a day's work in nearly 10 years and by 2011 I was a complete mess,\" she told The New York Post in the same year. \"Every time I saw an aircraft, I panicked.\" But after a spell in rehab starting in April that year, she became sober and regained custody. Ms Borders' daughter Noelle told the New York Post on Wednesday her mother \"fought an amazing battle\". \"Not only is she the 'Dust Lady' but she is my hero and she will forever live through me,\" she said. In November 2014, Ms Borders revealed that she had stomach cancer and said she believed the illness was a result of her experience in 2001. \"I definitely believe it because I haven't had any illnesses,\" she told US newspaper the New Jersey Journal. \"I don't have high blood pressure ... high cholesterol, diabetes.\" \"How do you go from being healthy to waking up the next day with cancer?\" Thousands of people who were at Ground Zero that day have been since diagnosed with cancer, but medical officials have not confirmed a direct link between the conditions and the attacks. Stomach cancer is one of more than 50 conditions covered by the James Zadroga 9\/11 Health and Compensation Act, signed into law by Barack Obama in 2010.

{"text":"First, let me just comment on what I liked about the movie. The special effects were fantastic, and very rarely did I feel like I was watching a video game. There, that is the last nice thing I have to say about this film. In fact, I would just like everyone reading this to take note that I can't even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing. <br \/><br \/>I have innumerable complaints about the film, but four major complaints jump to mind. My first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the \"\"plot twist\"\" (if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away) where Lois's 5 year-old son turns out to be the super-powered child of Superman. When the crying super-child throws a piano at Lex's henchman to save his mother, I almost got up and left the theater. Singer could have made a much better Superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but latently super-powered illegitimate child. It's been 5 days since I saw the movie and I still want to vomit. <br \/><br \/>My next major complaint has to do with the fact that Superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space. It doesn't take comic book guy from the Simpsons to point out what's wrong with that. I don't know how many comic books Brian Singer has read, but when Superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet. Whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any Superman-related projects ever again. The concept is as ridiculous as making a Dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun. Why not just have Superman eat kryptonite? He can eat it and then brush his teeth with it, and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas. That's not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in re-entry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground. <br \/><br \/>My third major complaint has to do with the fact that Singer slaps movie-goers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie. I have to take issue with his characterization of Superman as the only son of a God-like Jor-el sent to Earth to be a savior. Jor-el wasn't all-wise, he was just a scientist. And he didn't send his son to earth to be a savior, he threw him in a rocket and hurriedly fired it into space because his planet was about to explode. I'll buy the Christ allegory if Brian Singer can show me the part in the Bible where God sends Christ to Earth because Heaven was about to explode, and then radioactive pieces of Heaven become Christ's primary weakness. Furthermore, the \"\"crucifixion\"\" scene where Luthor stabs Superman in the side with a kryptonite \"\"spear\"\" just makes me want to slam my face into a brick until I'm too brain-dead to notice the brazenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be tainting the man of steel for the foreseeable future. They might as well rename this movie \"\"Superman Returns: the Passion of the Christ.\"\"<br \/><br \/>And speaking of Luthor, my last major complaint has to do with Singer's depiction of Lex Luthor. Lex Luthor is a shrewd, cold-hearted business tycoon who is more apt to run for President (which he does in the comics) than try to destroy the world. The man wants money and power; he wants to be in charge, not wreck everything. Yet the Luthor we see Superman Returns, as well as all the previous Superman movies, is a wacky theatrical dunce who comes up with zany schemes to destroy the world. If Singer had the slightest loyalty to the characters instead of the (quite awful) previous Superman movies, this film might not be such an unbearable travesty. Maybe Singer's next project can be a Batman movie where he focuses on the interpretation of Batman from 1960s TV show. ZAM! WHAP! POW!!<br \/><br \/>To summarize, I don't know what I hate more, the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good reviews. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but if you don't hate this movie then your opinion is wrong. I sincerely encourage anyone who reads this not to see this movie if you haven't already. Don't see it, don't buy it when it comes out on DVD, don't rent it...basically don't contribute any money towards it in any way. This movie does not deserve to make any money. In fact, I think that for every person that sees this movie, Bryan Singer should be fined 45 billion dollars. If you're a Superman fan and you really want to see this movie, just bend over and have someone kick you in the balls and you'll get the same experience without having to waste 2 hours of your time.\"","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":4888}

Of course, this important piece of information was reserved for near the end of their memo coverage.On CBS Evening News, Anchor Scott Pelley declared in the opening tease that \"A source tells CBS News that President Trump asked the FBI Director to end his investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.\" \"This story was first reported this evening by The New York Times, but our source has confirmed the contents of the memo,\" Pelley added, admitting that CBS was getting their information from somewhere else.NBC Nightly News also played up the dubious memo, but they were the only network to go out of their way to note that no one has actually seen it outside of the anonymous source. According to Justice Correspondent Pete Williams:None of this comes from Mr. Comey directly. He has yet to say anything publicly since he was fired a week ago tonight, but he did tell friends and a few people at the FBI about what he wrote in that memo at the time and they're the ones describing it now \u2026 First is to try and get the actual Comey memo and not just rely just on people who can tell us what it said, to see what it said and then perhaps talk to Mr. Comey.Despite their championing of a mysterious memo alleging impropriety by the President of the United States, it's easily challenged by the simple fact that acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe testified to the Senate last week that there has been no interference in their investigations by the Trump administration.On ABC, Senior White House Correspondent downplayed McCabe's testimony as just some sort of defiant statement meant for the White House:VEGA: The acting director coming to Comey's defense last week.

{"text":"Riding high on the success of \"\"Rebel Without a Cause\"\", came a tidal wave of 'teen' movies. These movies were targeted towards the newly emerging teenage demographic, addressing their interests, concerns, and desire for rebellion and identity formation. Films such as \"The Wild One\", \"Blackboard Jungle\", and \"East of Eden\" were all successful in capturing the spirit of teenage rebellion and angst. \n\nHowever, not all movies were well-received by both audiences and critics. Some were criticized for promoting violence and juvenile delinquency, while others were deemed shallow and predictable. Regardless, the trend of teen movies continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s, evolving to address new issues such as drug use, racism, and the changing roles of women in society. \n\nSome notable examples include \"Gidget\", \"The Breakfast Club\", and \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\". These films became classics, resonating with audiences and shaping the cultural narrative around adolescence. Today, the legacy of these teen movies can still be felt in contemporary coming-of-age films that address the same issues and themes.","prompt_len":92.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1120}

The same tribunal sentenced party chief Motiur Rahman Nizami to die last week. Another leader, Mir Quasem Ali, was also given the death penalty on Sunday. Kamaruzzaman, 62, was found guilty of crimes which include a mass killing of at least 120 unarmed male farmers in the northern border town of Sohagpur. He is due to be hanged. The convictions of Jamaat-e-Islami leaders have outraged supporters, who have been on a three-day strike, due to end on Monday, in protest at Nizami's sentencing last Wednesday. There are different estimates for the number of people killed in the nine-month Bangladeshi war of secession from Pakistan in 1971. Government figures suggest as many as three million people died, while some say that figure is too high and unverifiable. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina set up the war crimes tribunal in 2010 to look into abuses during the independence war. The first person the tribunal executed was Jamaat-e-Islami senior leader Abdul Kader Mullah last December. But earlier this year the Supreme Court overturned the death sentence passed against another senior JI leader, Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, commuting it to life imprisonment. Critics of the controversial court say the government is using the tribunal to target political opponents. But the Awami League, which leads the current government, says it is necessary to help the country come to terms with its past.

Members of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, which represents mainly Catholic teachers, is the only teaching union who voted for strike action. As a result, Catholic schools are likely to be most affected. The body that oversees Catholic education in Northern Ireland, the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS), has said all schools should remain open, if not for children, then for teachers and other staff who do not want to strike. However, with canteen and bus and train staff likely to take action, some schools have asked only senior and exam classes to come in, using alternative transport. They have told pupils to bring packed lunches as school catering staff may be involved in industrial action. Parents should liaise with schools regarding attendance on Friday and consider making alternative arrangements to get children to school where possible. There will be no Ulsterbus services on Friday except the express Belfast to Dublin service at 23:00 GMT. The air link buses that service George Best City Airport and Belfast International Airport will also not be running. No trains, local or Enterprise, will run either. Bus \u00c3\u2030ireann services between Belfast and Dublin will operate on Friday from Glengall Street (service marked BE above departure times). Bus \u00c3\u2030ireann service 33 from Derry to Dublin will also operate (services marked BE above departure times). Translink has put procedures in place to reimburse the value of a day's travel for any customers who had pre-purchased tickets. Police will not be enforcing bus lanes during the strike action on Friday, but this does not apply to the hard shoulder the buses use on motorways. Strangford ferry - the company said it would not know if services would be affected until Friday morning. The Department of Health have said arrangements have been put in place to ensure \"critical services will be maintained\". Cover will be provided for emergency services and activities. This will include some outpatients, inpatients and the most vulnerable who require care in a community setting and in residential and children's homes. Non-critical planned procedures and appointments have been cancelled. The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service declared a \"major incident\" on Thursday night, which means paramedics who were due to begin strike action at midnight must continue working. The Social Security Agency may be operating a reduced service. Child Maintenance Service (CMS) may be operating a reduced telephone service and, if you do phone, waiting times for a response may be longer. Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunals Service is working to minimise any disruption to court business. It anticipates that the number of cases listed will be lower than a normal Friday, as fewer cases have been adjourned to Friday 13 March. When dealing with cases, judges will be mindful of the wider issues relating to access to public transport and the impact of caring responsibilities if schools are closed, particularly where a party to the proceedings is not present. The Department of the Environment said anyone with an MOT test booked for Friday should attend their test centre as normal. It said every effort would be made to alert customers to potential disruption or cancellation and said customers could contact their test centre to confirm arrangements in advance of the test time on the day. If insufficient staff are available to deliver booked tests, a new appointment will be made at no additional cost and at the earliest possible opportunity. Libraries NI is advising anyone planning to go to their library to contact the library before travelling, to check if it is open. The Northern Ireland Fire & Rescue Service said its members were not taking part in the industrial action so service would not be affected. The NI Prison Service said it was not anticipating any disruption to prison visits.

{"text":"The first regards it as a useful sideshow distracting the international community, causing serial headaches for the US and its allies, and diverting hostile diplomatic attention that might be directed towards China. This is something that China broadly supports and manipulates for its own interests. The second sees the actions of its ostensibly fellow Marxist-Leninist neighbour as those of a blackmailer of China, a huge liability, a place run by narcissistic leadership stuck in a time warp half a century behind the rest of the world. The first assumes that China has real influence and power over North Korea and has some level of control of the situation there. The second suggests that it has far less. With the suspected test of a hydrogen bomb by the DPRK on 5 January, can we see any evidence of which of the two views might be the more accurate description of what Chinese leaders themselves actually think? There are some things we need to bear in mind when trying to answer this question. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has visited an astonishing 37 countries since becoming president in 2013 - but the DPRK has so far not been one of them. The DPRK has reciprocated, with young leader Kim Jong-un not once taking the short, hour-long plane ride to Beijing since his elevation in 2011. We also know that in the last 10 years, Chinese condemnation of the three previous nuclear tests has grown increasingly pointed and blunt. The Beijing Ministry of Foreign Affairs this time curtly announced that it \"strongly opposed\" the DPRK's suspected testing of a hydrogen bomb. In 2012, it reportedly also stopped energy supply for three days after the last DPRK nuclear test. Even something as seemingly trivial as the abrupt cancellation of performances by a visiting DPRK song and dance troupe to China late last year - because they were planning to sing songs celebrating Pyongyang's creation of a new powerful bomb - indicate Beijing's dim views. Despite this, Chinese leaders do operate within clear constraints. The rhetoric they use towards the DPRK remains full of warm words affirming an alliance based on historic links and unshakable friendship. This is for the simple reason that much as they regard the current regime in Pyongyang as bad, other options (a unified peninsula under South Korean, and therefore American, dominance, or, even worse, a failed, anarchic state with no governance at all) are worse. It seems that while there might be some in Beijing (mostly in the think tank community and the more shrill, nationalist press) who believe China has some level of back channel control, all that we have learned in the last couple of days tends to support the idea that China's leaders believe their influence is limited, and their levels of frustration are high. There is a bigger context for this. China's leaders currently have a lot on their plate. The current downturn in the economy and the turmoil on the stock exchange in Shanghai, along with serious concerns about what sort of role they might need to play in the ongoing Middle East crisis (source of half of their petrol supply) and other geopolitical issues are more than enough to keep them busy. Having yet one more problem in their neighbourhood demanding their time and attention is unlikely to be welcome. They could happily live without the drama of this test. The North Koreans are also driven by a similar distrust and wariness. For them, having a nuclear capacity grants them leverage as much over the Chinese as the Americans, their supposed chief enemy. The great ancient Chinese philosopher Han Fei said two and a half thousand years ago that while people constantly prepare themselves to deal with their enemies, real calamity comes from those who they view as friends. For the Chinese leaders, the North Koreans' \"alliance\" is a real and continuing burden, one that they cannot walk away from, but have no clear plan how to deal with. So far, strangely enough, they have adopted the same tactics as America has under Obama, choosing simply to try to ignore the DPRK and sideline it. This week we have probably seen that tactic abruptly ended for both China and the US. Like it or not, now Beijing will need to do something. It might take the softer form of arranging a Xi presidential visit, or the harder one of placing real pressure on the US to restart the Six Party Talks, dormant since 2009. If these happen, then Pyongyang will have shown once more that they remain masters of blackmail and manipulation of their vast, and seemingly powerful western neighbour, and that, more than any other country, they continue to show the limits of Beijing's diplomatic clout and influence.

In August, he hugged the crown prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan,  inspiring some droll memes. Mr Modi has also hugged Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. The mother of all hugs came in January with a humongous embrace of President Obama. Delirious Indian news channels ran tickers screaming 'Modi\/Obama hug' because, as The New York Times reported, \"this was not expected\". The newspaper dubbed the development as a \"quadrilateral security hug\". Whatever the case, Mr Modi has learned to stop worrying about public displays of affection when he meets the rich and the powerful: Google \"Modi hugging\", and it spits out more than 300,000 results in under a second. Indians and their politicians are not known for being so touchy-feely. Cuban leader Fidel Castro scandalised many Indians when he gave former prime minister Indira Gandhi a huge hug during a summit in Delhi in 1983. Mrs Gandhi, wrote a biographer Pranay Gupte, \"never an emotionally demonstrative person, visibly recoiled from the hug, managing only a faintly polite smile in the interest of diplomatic niceties\". Even Mr Modi was different in his early days as a party functionary in Delhi. Biographer Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay remembers him as a \"warm and affectionate man and his overall body language touched a chord\". Much later, as the chief minister of Gujarat, he could be a \"bit cold and remote\" with his peers at meetings, \"shaking hands and maybe touching somebody on his shoulders if he knew somebody particularly well\". \"But this is different, this hugging spree. He was never so overt and aggressive in his public display of affection,\" says Mr Mukhopadhyay. \"His bear hugs are to convey the message that he's the representative of more than a billion Indians. He's saying 'I have demographic clout'. \"And he's sending the message back home that 'I am being respected around the world, so respect me at home and give me your votes'. It's a powerful piece of imagery.\" People see before they hear, and a leader's body language is a vital asset. The ritual of shaking hands is all about restraint and respect. Hugs go beyond the formal protocol - they show affection, comradeship and spontaneity. Mr Modi, clearly, believes that hugs fetch more dividends; they are not about cuddly politics alone. The body language is also tweaked to cater to different audiences. Sociologist Shiv Visvanathan says Mr Modi has three core audiences: the diaspora, foreign leaders and the Indian people. \"To the Indian masses, he speaks from a great distance. To the diaspora, he speaks with a sense of conviviality. To the world leaders, he changes his body language, gives them big hugs,\" says Dr Visvanathan. \"The effort is too obvious.

{"text":"Beautifully crafted first-half goals from Jason Cummings and Martin Boyle put Hibs ahead. James Keatings and another for Cummings were added in quick succession in the second half. It leaves Ayr at the bottom, three points behind next week's hosts, who lost 5-0 to St Mirren. Ayr looked nervous, but Neil Lennon's visitors started the game with intent and came close after only three minutes. Cummings sensed an opportunity after a mistake from the Ayr defence, but his right-footed effort came back out off the post. The striker was hungry for a goal and, following some skilful footwork by John McGinn, the midfielder whipped in a cross for Cumming to nod it home. It was two shortly after as Grant Holt's low cross was met at the back post by the oncoming Boyle to slide the ball under goalkeeper Greg Fleming. The second half was more of the same. McGinn and Boyle both came close with long distance efforts and Holt came inches away from connecting with a cut-back six yards out. Hibs' third came when McGinn found Cummings in space on the right and a simple ball set up well-positioned substitute Keatings to slip the ball through the legs of Fleming. Cummings wasn't done for the day and added his second and Hibs' fourth after Keatings turned supplier with a delightful through ball. Ian McCall's hosts rarely threatened, with visiting goalkeeper Ross Laidlaw equal to efforts from Michael Rose and Daryll Meggat when they did get a glimpse of goal. Ayr United manager Ian McCall: \"I think if we win 5-0 we might stay up or go into a play-off, but that's not really the point. \"I thought in the first half we were awful and we looked nervous and weren't at it and we kept giving the ball to Hibs players and they hurt us. \"To be perfectly honest, we were very fortunate to only be 2-0 down at half time, but in the second half I thought we more than matched them. \"We threw caution to the wind and were due one or two goals in the second half and I was very pleased with that. \"It is not about me picking the players up, it is about them picking me up as there's going to be loads of good things happening this club as we've got a lot of good young players and exciting young players. \"If the worst comes to the worst then our target is to win League One.\" Hibernian head coach Neil Lennon: \"We were different class and it was a very polished performance - a clean sheet away from home again and we were dynamite. \"They are playing with freedom now and shackles are off. \"There are no pressure on the games and they are really enjoying themselves at the minute. \"We've rotated the squad a bit and those who came in have done themselves no harm. \"We've got Premiership quality players and they looked really exciting today.\" Match ends, Ayr United 0, Hibernian 4.

Here are a few mistakes that you might be making that have brought you in such a position:Failing to Keep a To-Do List:With so many things to do on a daily basis, it is very likely to forget one or more of them if you don't keep a to-do list. It is also possible that you resort to using abbreviations or short taglines in your list and might forget later what they meant.This often leads you to skip the assigned task. It is not only important to set a to-do list but also to prioritize the items according to their importance or urgency.Not Being Able to Manage Distractions:You must have enough will power to manage any distraction that can hinder your progress. You are really keen to watch that Chelsea match at 3 pm but have an important task to complete. Don't let that match become a distraction instead, make it your motivation so you complete your work before time instead of delaying it.Taking on Too Much Work:You are aware of your capabilities and how much work you can manage within a specific span of time.Don't take an amount of work that surpasses your ability to be complete it on time.It is okay to say no at times. You can slow down your progress a bit and take some time out for a break or relaxation.Not Setting Any Goals or Targets:You set a goal to work in this office and achieved it. Do you think that was enough?After achieving a goal wasn't it necessary to now set some higher goals for yourself to achieve.Never stop at a particular point because it will affect your performance in a negative way. Keep setting targets that you need to achieve on daily, weekly, monthly, or even yearly basis. These will help you in staying motivated and working within the given time limit.Multitasking:It is not wise to act like a \"Jack of all Trades\" especially if you are not. It is okay to say no to certain things and do what you are best at. Make a priority list of your tasks and perform them by applying the one-at-a-time strategy.The simplest way out from your time management problem is to install a time tracking software that will alert you of the deadlines approaching ahead and","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":2901}

For example, let's consider a circuit with two resistors, R1 and R2, in series. According to our unified approach, the total resistance of the circuit is simply R1 + R2. Similarly, if we have two capacitors, C1 and C2, in parallel, the total capacitance of the circuit would be C1 + C2. \n\nBy using this approach, students can easily and quickly solve problems without having to memorize complicated formulas for each physical quantity. This approach also helps to reinforce important concepts such as the additive nature of resistors in series and the parallel nature of capacitors in parallel.\n\nTo further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we provide several example problems. For instance, let's consider a circuit with three resistors in series, R1, R2, and R3, with resistances of 2 \u03a9, 4 \u03a9, and 6 \u03a9, respectively. Using our approach, the total resistance of the circuit is simply 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 \u03a9. \n\nSimilarly, let's consider a circuit with two capacitors in parallel, C1 and C2, with capacitances of 2 \u03bcF and 3 \u03bcF, respectively. Using our approach, the total capacitance of the circuit is simply 2 + 3 = 5 \u03bcF. \n\nOverall, our unified approach to addition of physical quantities provides an intuitive and consistent way for students to solve problems in introductory physics, making the subject more accessible and enjoyable for all.","prompt_len":443.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1793}

If this density is measured by the amount of mass-energy contained in a certain region of space, then one can determine if its density exceeds that of the standard matter of the universe. On the basis of this knowledge one can then conclude whether or not a particular region of space conforms to the curvature imposed by the dark matter. In order to test the theory of dark matter, astronomers are now also proposing ways to test it using observational approaches. These results will hopefully clarify the physics of dark matter and allow us to explore much more about","prompt_len":225.0,"label":"gpt2","text_length":1620}

This study aimed to investigate if the prevalence of fast-food chains, convenience stores, and vending machines around schools could influence children's SSB intake. The research also examined whether socioeconomic status (SES) affects this association. Data was collected from several elementary schools in urban and rural areas, and statistical methods were used to analyze the results.\n\nThe findings showed that children attending schools in areas with a higher density of fast-food restaurants, convenience stores, and vending machines were more likely to consume SSB. The study also revealed that the effect of the school's proximity to these outlets was more significant in low-SES areas, indicating that children from disadvantaged backgrounds may be more susceptible to unhealthy food choices.\n\nThe study's conclusions highlight the need for intervention programs to reduce the accessibility and availability of SSBs in schools' surroundings, particularly in low-income areas. Policies focusing on limiting the number of fast-food chains and convenience stores near schools could have a significant impact on children's health and prevent health disparities resulting from socioeconomic status.  Overall, the research offers valuable insights into the relationships between school characteristics and SSB consumption in elementary students, which could inform public health policy and contribute to the development of effective health interventions.","prompt_len":195.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1653}

{"text":"The Yadav family, reported to have 20 members and counting in politics, dominates the Samajwadi Party (SP) at all levels. Its founder and patriarch, Mulayam Singh Yadav, is the national president of the party.  His elder son Akhilesh Yadav is the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. Mulayam Singh Yadav's brother Shivpal Yadav is a minister in the state government. All SP members of the lower house of the Indian parliament are from the Yadav family. Other members occupy local and regional offices. Even though political families now dominate, or are found burrowed within most major political parties in India, no other political family has the sheer numbers and sprawl across political offices at all levels of Indian politics that the Yadav family does. Is India's politics becoming less dynastic? But last month, old tensions among the Yadavs broke out into open conflict. Akhilesh Yadav moved against his uncle Shivpal by sacking ministers and bureaucrats believed to be loyal to him. Mulayam Singh Yadav backed his brother, removing his son from the position of state president of the Samajwadi Party and appointing Shivpal Yadav to the position instead. For the past month, son and uncle and their respective factions have been fighting it out, with the patriarch playing mediator. The drama is still unfolding. As of today, several of Akhilesh Yadav's loyalists, including family members Ram Gopal Yadav and Udaiveer Yadav, have been expelled from the party, while Shivpal Yadav and his loyalists have been sacked from the cabinet. It is also not clear who the party's chief ministerial candidate is: although the SP had on 17 October named Akhilesh Yadav as its candidate for chief minister, the Shivpal Yadav faction is now proposing Mulayam Singh Yadav's name for the position. In the meantime, the SP's election campaign has come to a standstill. The Yadavs are only one of several families in charge of India's regional governments. According to data I collected after India's most recent round of regional elections this year, the chief ministers of 14 of India's 31 regional governments, encompassing 53% of India's population, come from political families - that is, they have family members who either preceded or followed them into politics. Some chief ministers such as Parkash Singh Badal of the Akali Dal in northern state of Punjab belong to families that head their parties. Others like Chief Minister Raman Singh of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the central state of Chhattisgarh have families that occupy subordinate positions within larger political parties. Still others, such as the chief minister of the northern state of Rajasthan, Vasundhara Raje Scindia of the BJP, are from old political families with multiple prominent members in politics. Others, such as north-eastern Meghalaya state Chief Minister Mukul Sangma of the Congress party and West Bengal state Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of the Trinamool Congress, have only recently been joined by one or two family members who are still relatively unknown. Regardless, it is clear that we cannot understand the dynamics of regional government in India now, without understanding the dynamics of dynastic politics. That is why the Yadav family feud is worth paying attention to. One of the major advantages of dynastic politics is that it acts as a glue to keep the party together - or at least it produces a lower likelihood of dissension than the alternatives. This is not because political families do not have feuds.  They have plenty. The Yadav family feud is simply the most recent of a long line of such others, including the rift between former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her daughter-in-law Maneka Gandhi in the Nehru-Gandhi family, or between the brothers MK Stalin and MK Azhagiri of the Karunanidhi family in southern Tamil Nadu state, the Scindias in central Madhya Pradesh state, or the Thackerays in western Maharashtra state. But dynasties usually hold parties together, notwithstanding such feuds, because the loser does not have a good exit option. Losers who leave the parent party rarely obtain a comparable position elsewhere: they are not trustworthy enough for a rival party. The case of the Scindias who occupy senior positions in both the Congress and the BJP, is relatively rare. Those family members who form their own party are sooner or later wiped out. Because the dynastic mantle can logically fall on only one successor, there is usually only one party left standing when the dust settles. When Chandrababu Naidu won the struggle of succession in the Telugu Desam after NT Rama Rao's (NTR) death, for example NTR's widow Laxmi Parvathi formed a party of her own, the NTR-TDP. But the new party soon fell by the wayside. The history of other family feuds suggests that the Samajwadi Party feud may resolve in one of two ways: either warring family members, will end up remaining, albeit rancorously, within the same party, or, if there is a split, one of the two branches may end up becoming the dominant one over time. Regardless, it is likely to be unusually damaging to the party's electoral prospects for one main reason - this is a feud across rather than within generations. Dynastic ties, have often in the past, served to smooth succession crises: it is easier for members of the older generation to cede their positions to members of their own family. But an inter-generational feud, in which members of two different generations are fighting over the same position is less common. An intergenerational feud is especially damaging to the SP because of the large population of young people in Uttar Pradesh. India is a very young country to start with: half of its 1.25 billion people are under 27, while almost two-thirds are younger than 35. But the population of Uttar Pradesh is even younger: with a median age of 20, Uttar Pradesh is one of two Indian states with the youngest population in the country. When Akhilesh Yadav became chief minister for the first time in 2012, he became the state's youngest-ever chief minister. He quickly became an icon for the young, who are poorly represented in higher-level institutions in India. Now, at 43, he is still the youngest contender for the position of chief minister in the field: his father Mulayam Singh Yadav is just short of 77, the Bahujan Samaj Party's Mayawati is 60, and the Congress nominee, Sheila Dixit, is almost 80. The undermining of Akhilesh Yadav, then, regardless of whether or not it splits the Samajwadi Party as an organisation, will damage the party's capacity to attract the new generations that populate UP's electorate.

{"text":"The MP for Caernarfon Boroughs had already served as chancellor, minister of munitions and secretary of state for war during World War One. It was in his role as prime minister that he saw the tide of war turning in favour of the Allies. But despite his roles the man at the helm of British politics was once an opponent of war. He had argued vehemently against the Second Boer War at the turn of the 20th Century. Hear more: Britain's first WI More WW1 stories from Wales World War One What did WW1 do for women? Later, he had pledged his support to reduce Britain's expenditure on armaments, describing the build-up as reckless. So what swayed his opinion? Some believe Lloyd George's change of heart related to his love of Wales. \"When Germany declared war, Lloyd George wasn't sure which way to go,\" said Emrys Williams from the Lloyd George Memorial Museum at Criccieth, Gwynedd. \"But as soon as Germany started violating the borders and the small country of Belgium, he was dedicated to winning the war. \"He was from Wales, another small country, and he could relate to the plight of the Belgians who faced this aggressor.\" Lloyd George was perceptive, recognising the mood of the public and allowing that to feed into his politics. But regardless of what swayed his opinion to support the war, the policies he pushed in his various roles in government impacted on the shape of the conflict. DAVID LLOYD GEORGE FACTS SOURCE: BBC HISTORY Emrys Williams said as minister of munitions, Lloyd George had realised \"very quickly the British Army was unprepared and he set about increasing the number of machine guns per battalion\". \"The decorated Lord Kitchener who was secretary of state thought it could be won with the Cavalry on horses,\" said Mr Williams. \"But this was a new kind of war and Lloyd George was one of the first to realise it needed armament.\" To facilitate this he set up ammunition factories across Britain to supply the constant demand from the front line and he solved the labour shortage with a novel approach. \"Through employing women at the factories he changed the whole format of British society,\" said Mr Williams. Between 1914 and 1918 nearly a million of the so-called munitionettes were employed in these factories. Another quirk which set Lloyd George apart from other ministers was his readiness to use the informed advice available to him from men who had the experience he lacked. He acted upon this advice as minister of munitions and later as prime minister when he formed a small cohort of advisors which became known as the Garden Suburb. Following Lord Kitchener's death in 1916, Lloyd George succeeded him. Just a few weeks later Britain entered the most traumatic offensive of the conflict, the Battle of the Somme where around a million men were killed or wounded. Earlier that summer the newly appointed secretary of state travelled to Aberystwyth for the annual Welsh cultural festival, the National Eisteddfod. In a stirring speech he dismissed calls for the event to be cancelled telling those at the eisteddfod that the honour of Britain was not dead, nor was her might broken. Within the space of a few months Lloyd George rose to the top of the political pole, becoming prime minister. Emrys Williams said his decision to appoint a war cabinet on his promotion to PM helped swing the pendulum of the conflict towards the Allies. \"He created a centralised government machine which unified command on the Western front, the war cabinet helped him make decisive decisions,\" he said. Lloyd George also persuaded the Royal Navy to introduce a convoy system and it's argued these changes were among a combination of factors which helped end the conflict. Lloyd George Society president Lord Thomas of Gresford also argues the character of the then prime minister was an important factor. \"He contributed a down-to-earth understanding of the way people lived, worked and fought,\" he said. \"He brought to his cabinet a dynamism, a sympathy and an understanding. It was that which led him to win the war and to go on to Versailles and negotiate the peace.\" ","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":4098}

The violence is the worst seen in the region for years. Some 800 extra troops are being sent to help restore order. More than 200 other people have been injured in the clashes, in which government forces have fired live rounds and tear gas. A curfew is in place across much of the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley after a police post was set alight and a military airbase targeted during the latest clashes. Disputed Kashmir is claimed in its entirety by both India and Pakistan and has been a flashpoint for more than 60 years, sparking two wars between the countries. Kashmir deaths after key militants killed Why a cricket match caused student unrest in Kashmir Within the disputed Muslim-majority territory, some militant groups have taken up arms to fight for independence from Indian rule or a merger with Pakistan. The last bout of serious violence in the region was in the summer of 2010, when more than 100 people died in anti-India protests, which broke out after police shot dead a teenager. Burhan Wani is largely credited with reviving the image of militancy in Indian-administered Kashmir. Born to a highly educated upper-class Kashmiri family, Wani is believed to have been driven to  militancy at the age of 15, when he was beaten up by police along with his brother \"for no reason\". Wani was extremely active on social media and, unlike militants in the past, did not hide his identity. His video messages, which would often go viral in Kashmir, were on the topics of Indian injustice, and the need for young people to stand up to oppression. Indian officials have said that he was instrumental in persuading local boys to take up arms. Why the death of militant has Kashmiris up in arms Almost all the dead in the current outbreak of violence are protesters. The policeman died after his car went into a river in the Jhelum area on Sunday. Police say the vehicle was pushed in by crowds but some accounts say it went into the water after the driver lost control in an attempt to avoid stone-throwing mobs. The BBC's Riyaz Masroor in Srinagar says tensions remained high on Monday, with crowds attempting to breach curfew orders. Four top separatist leaders released a joint statement in which they called on India's government to \"abandon the policy of stopping people's marches by bullets\". The violence has led to the suspension of a popular Hindu religious pilgrimage to the Amarnath temple shrine, which has stranded some 15,000 devotees in the neighbouring region of Jammu, Indian media reported. More than 2,000 pilgrims who were on the way back from the temple have been airlifted out of Kashmir, police officials told the BBC. Thousands attended Wani's funeral which was held in his hometown of Tral, about 40km (25 miles) south of Srinagar, on Saturday. Police stations and military installations were attacked in violent clashes afterwards, with several buildings burned down, police added. The state government has said that it would also investigate reports of excessive police violence towards unarmed protesters. Rights groups have described the current situation as a state of emergency. Hospitals struggled to cope with wounded protesters and phone and internet services were suspended. The level of separatist insurgency violence in the region has ebbed and flowed since 1989, but it has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people, mainly civilians.

This decision has sparked concern among those in the international community who fear that the expansion could further destabilize the region and damage the prospects for peace between Israelis and Palestinians. While the Trump administration has been largely silent on the issue, some believe that the move could ultimately prove harmful to U.S. interests in the region, particularly as Trump seeks to forge closer ties with countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt. At the same time, there are those who argue that international pressure on Israel has been counterproductive in the past and that direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians are the only way forward.

{"text":"The dominant explanation for the Black Death is the plague theory, which attributes the outbreak to Yersinia pestis, also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern China in 1865, eventually spreading to India. The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin, after whom the pathogen was named Yersinia pestis. The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul-Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second that lack resistance. When the second population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human epidemic.","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":1282}

One of my primary responsibilities was to lead large groups of Jewish college students on inspiring trips to Israel.Of course, the personal inspiration for me, was very often greater than the inspiration for some of the students.One episode has inspired me since the moment it occurred and it is directly related to Tisha B'Av.We always were sure to take the students on the Tunnel Tours of the Western Wall. For me, it was incredible to see the beauty and grandeur of the gigantic white stones at the original base of the Western Wall. Continuation:\n\nHowever, on one trip, as we approached the exit of the tunnel, we heard loud chanting and shouting from above. Upon reaching the surface, we saw that Muslim worshippers had barricaded themselves inside one of the alcoves near the Western Wall, refusing to let anyone enter or exit. The Israeli police were called, and negotiations ensued. Eventually, the worshippers were removed, but not before the incident had escalated into a full-blown riot.\n\nThis experience deeply affected me, as Tisha B'Av was just a few days away. Tisha B'Av is a day of mourning in the Jewish calendar, commemorating the destruction of the First and Second Temples in Jerusalem, as well as other tragedies throughout Jewish history. The incident at the Western Wall was a stark reminder of the ongoing tensions and conflicts surrounding this holy site, and the need for continued healing and reconciliation.\n\nSince then, I have made it a point to incorporate discussions and reflections on the complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the history of Jerusalem into my teachings and interactions with students.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent ES between 2010 and 2017 at a tertiary care hospital in Thailand. Patients were followed up until the end of 2019 for the occurrence of cholangiocarcinoma. The association between ES and the risk of cholangiocarcinoma was assessed using Cox regression analysis with adjustment for potential confounders.\n\nResults: A total of 1,594 patients who underwent ES were included in the study, with a median follow-up of 69 months. During the follow-up period, 16 patients developed cholangiocarcinoma, corresponding to an incidence rate of 255 per 100,000 person-years. The incidence of cholangiocarcinoma was higher in patients with a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis or previous cholecystectomy. However, after adjustment for these confounders, ES was not associated with an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.08-1.40).\n\nConclusion: Our study suggests that ES is not associated with an elevated long-term risk of cholangiocarcinoma in patients without primary sclerosing cholangitis or a history of previous cholecystectomy.

Justice committee member Edwin Poots said there had not been \"such a poor service\" from the PPS in \"decades\". The DUP MLA added that there was \"a public dissatisfaction\" with the PPS. Sir Keir Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions for England and Wales, produced a report in May on three cases linked to the alleged rape of M\u00e1ir\u00eda Cahill. She told a BBC NI programme that an IRA member raped her when she was 16. She had accused the PPS and the police of failing to properly investigate her allegations. The PPS apologised to Ms Cahill after the report by Sir Keir concluded that it had \"let down\" her and other victims. Mr McGrory told the justice committee on Thursday that the report was \"more difficult reading\" for the PPS and acknowledged that \"blurred\" lines of communication with the organisation was one of the problems. He was also addressing the report by Northern Ireland's attorney general, John Larkin, in relation to the PPS's decision not to prosecute Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams for allegedly withholding evidence about his rapist brother. The committee chair, Alasdair Ross of the DUP, put it to Mr McGrory that \"public confidence [in the PPS] has been damaged\" by the two reviews.

{"text":"The prime minister will say her commitment to changing the country is \"undimmed\" a year after taking office. But she will acknowledge her reduced voting power in the Commons after her election gamble backfired. And in the speech, on Tuesday, she will urge other parties to work with her on ideas to tackle \"unfairness\". Ministers loyal to Mrs May have dismissed reports of plots to remove her as drink-fuelled \"gossip\", but Labour remains on an election footing, with leader Jeremy Corbyn saying he hopes for a fresh poll in September. Mrs May will return to the message from her first day in Downing Street last July, when she succeeded David Cameron, and vow to lead what she called a \"one nation\" government that works for all and not just the \"privileged few\". BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said: \"You won't hear anyone in Downing Street call it a re-launch or a fightback, but after the tumult, the commotion of the last few months - voluntarily calling an election in which she went backwards - Theresa May will this week attempt to regain the political initiative\". In her speech, the PM will say that though the result of June's election was not what she wanted, \"those defining beliefs remain, my commitment to change in Britain is undimmed\". Her \"belief in the potential of the British people and what we can achieve together as a nation remains steadfast, and the determination I have to get to grips with the challenges posed by a changing world never more sure\", she will say. She will say she is convinced that the path she set out in her first speech outside Number 10 remains the right one. \"It will lead to the stronger, fairer Britain that we need.\" She will launch a review - of casual and low-paid work - by Matthew Taylor, a former top adviser to Tony Blair, which she commissioned when she became prime minister. It is thought Mr Taylor, who has been examining the use of zero-hours contracts and the rise in app-based firms such as Uber and Deliveroo, will stop short of calling for a compulsory minimum wage for those employed in the so-called gig economy, who do not have guaranteed hours or pay rates. But he is expected to propose a series of extra rights for those in insecure jobs and could also recommend shaking up the tax system to reduce the gap between employees and the self-employed. He is also likely to call for measures to improve job satisfaction for people working in minimum wage jobs, according to The Guardian. In her speech, Mrs May will say: \"When I commissioned this report I led a majority government in the House of Commons. The reality I now face as prime minister is rather different. \"In this new context, it will be even more important to make the case for our policies and our values, and to win the battle of ideas both in Parliament as well as in the country. \"So I say to the other parties in the House of Commons... come forward with your own views and ideas about how we can tackle these challenges as a country. \"We may not agree on everything, but through debate and discussion - the hallmarks of our parliamentary democracy - ideas can be clarified and improved and a better way forward found.\" She will acknowledge the fragile nature of her position in the Commons but insist it will not stop her taking \"the bold action necessary to secure a better future\".

{"text":"Few would argue that master animation director Hayao Miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability.<br \/><br \/>(No. Too many are focused on John Lassiter's \"\"amazing\"\" ability to steal other movies plots, turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be lauded as a genius . . . but i digress.)<br \/><br \/>Miyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues (usually ecologically themed), and has an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that was animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance. Still, Miyazaki (almost) never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies- children.<br \/><br \/>That said, I am at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability. Where else are you going to have a film where a three year old (my nephew Link) will sit still throughout the move, enthralled, a 7 year old (my niece Amber) loving it all her own (and able to appreciate the \"\"star power\"\" of Frankie Jonas and Noah Cyrus, a 12 year old (my nephew Aaron) who's review was \"\"of course it was good! Everything Miyazaki-san does is good!,\"\" a 32 year old animation fan brought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation (er, that would be me), and a 58 year old woman (my mother) able to connect with the mother characters (and I'm betting the older charas too) and loving the \"\"cuteness\"\" of the child characters.<br \/><br \/>And that is what I respect most about Miyazaki-san. He seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker. On the surface, \"\"Ponyo\"\" could be seen as a simple story about a little fish-girl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there, a little boy names Soske (somewhat like \"\"The Little Mermaid\"\"), but there is an entire different level at play here. True to form, Miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female characters Ponyo's Mother, Soske's mother, the older ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willed.<br \/><br \/>But the girl who takes the cake is Ponyo herself. Once she decides that she likes the human world, she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams. Her father is trying to keep her innocent, and keep her a magical fish, but young Ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination. <br \/><br \/>Once human, she teams up with her friend, Soske, whom she loves very much (although maybe not as much as ham). Soske is asked to be the man of the house (at age five) when his mother Lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during a typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by Ponyo on her quest to become human. Frankie Jonas (yes. He's related to the Jonas brothers. Can we just get past that please?) gives, perhaps, the best performance in the film as young Soske (which is good since he has the most lines). His character is also strong willed, but also very respectful and friendly- characteristics you're not likely to find in a child character on THIS side of the Pacific.<br \/><br \/>In the end, Ponyo's father, Fujimoto must cope with his daughter's decision and his estranges wife's wishes to allow her to be human. He hopes that Ponyo and Soske will \"\"remember him fondly.\"\" And once again, Miyazaki REFUSES to allow a character to become the stereotypical \"\"bad guy.\"\" Although Miyazaki has (for some reason) received some criticism for this, it is, honestly, what makes his movies magical and yet relatable. No one in real life is completely a \"\"bad person.\"\" All humans are various shades of gray. And that is exactly what Miyazaki does with his characters. <br \/><br \/>And then there's the animation itself. In a time when CGI would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film, especially the water, Miyazaki has chosen to incorporate NO CGI whatsoever. Certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means, but every film in this was hand-drawn and I, for one, was extremely grateful for that. The character animation was extremely fluid, and there even appeared to be some lip-sync going on (quite unusual for an anime film). The backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience. This is what animation used to look like- and what it SHOULD look like. <br \/><br \/>In the end, I found Ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable. Certainly not Miyazaki's best (in my opinion, that honor is still held by Kiki's Delivery Service), but still a 10-star fun movie for the ENTIRE family.\"","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":4656}
{"text":"By Jennifer C. GravelleThis paper reviews the current evidence on the incidence of the corporate tax from Harberger-type general equilibrium models, with special attention to the open economy. The analysis identifies the major drivers of the results from open-economy models and compares estimates from four major studies that have examined corporate tax incidence in an open economy. The studies vary in the assumptions of critical elasticities, and the variations account for differences in the reported estimates. The paper also discusses the limitations of the existing research and suggests areas for further investigation. One limitation is the reliance on certain assumptions, such as perfect competition and a constant return to scale. Another limitation is the use of simplified models that do not capture the complexity of real-world tax systems. The paper suggests that future research could address these limitations by incorporating more realistic assumptions and using more complex models.\n\nOverall, the paper concludes that while there is still much to learn about the incidence of corporate taxes, the current evidence suggests that the burden is likely shared between capital owners, workers, and consumers, with the exact distribution depending on a variety of factors, including the openness of the economy, the elasticity of substitution between inputs, and the degree of market power. The paper argues that policymakers should consider these factors when designing corporate tax policies, and that more research is needed to better understand the distributional effects of these policies.","prompt_len":516.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1609}

They found that the compound blocks pain by acting on a pain pathway that is not used by opioid drugs.By acting on a non-opioid pathway, researchers hope that the compound will eventually provide people with pain relief without the high risk of addictions that opioids bring.\"Nature has evolved molecules that are extremely sophisticated and can have unexpected applications,\" wrote Baldomera Olivera, Ph.D., professor in biology at the University of Utah. \"We were interested in using venoms to understand different pathways in the nervous system.\"The compound was effective in relieving pain in rats even after the compound left their bodies, suggesting that it could be used for long-lasting pain relief.\"We found that the compound was still working 72 hours after the injection, still preventing pain,\" said J. Michael McIntosh, M.D., professor of psychiatry at the University of Utah Health Sciences. This suggests that the compound could even be used to restore healthy function to the nervous system and eliminate pain.\"What is particularly exciting about these results is the aspect of prevention,\" McIntosh said. \"Once chronic pain has developed, it is difficult to treat. This compound offers a potential new pathway to prevent pain from developing in the first place and offer a new therapy to patients who have run out of options.\"After finding that the venom relieved pain in rats, researchers created the analog RgIA4 and used chemical tests to see if it would bind with the human pain receptor, which it did. The pain-relief effects are tested in rats by giving the animals a chemotherapy drug that causes extreme sensitivity to cold and touch. Rats that received RgIA4 reacted similarly to rats that were genetically modified to not have the pain receptor.Researchers also hope that the compound could provide more effective pain relief by acting on a different pathway than many of the current pain pills.\"RgIA4 works by an entirely new pathway, which opens the door for new opportunities to treat pain,\" said McIntosh. \"We feel that drugs that work by this pathway may reduce burden of opioid use.\"Use of the compound will move on to preclinical testing.","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":2702}

Furthermore, we investigate the effect of defects and imperfections on the self-collimation properties of the sonic crystal. We show that even small defects can significantly interfere with the propagation of the high-intensity sound beams and lead to increased divergence. However, by engineering the geometry and properties of the sonic crystal, it is possible to minimize the effects of defects and maintain a high degree of self-collimation. These results have important implications for the development of advanced acoustic devices and technologies that rely on the precise control of sound waves.

{"text":"The main use for steam turbines is in electricity generation (in the 1990s about 90% of the world's electric production was by use of steam turbines) however the recent widespread application of large gas turbine units and typical combined cycle power plants has resulted in reduction of this percentage to the 80% regime for steam turbines. In electricity production, the high speed of turbine rotation matches well with the speed of modern electric generators, which are typically direct connected to their driving turbines. In marine service, (pioneered on the Turbinia), steam turbines with reduction gearing (although the Turbinia has direct turbines to propellers with no reduction gearbox) dominated large ship propulsion throughout the late 20th century, being more efficient (and requiring far less maintenance) than reciprocating steam engines. Aside from electricity generation and marine propulsion, steam turbines have also found use in a variety of industrial applications. For example, they can be found in the processing of petroleum, chemicals, and even food. Additionally, steam turbines are commonly used in applications that require large amounts of mechanical power, such as driving compressors in gas pipelines or powering heavy machinery in manufacturing plants. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that steam turbines will continue to be a key player in energy production and other industrial applications for years to come.","prompt_len":854.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1461}

{"text":"First, if a Directive's deadline for implementation is not met, the member state cannot enforce conflicting laws, and a citizen may rely on the Directive in such an action (so called \"vertical\" direct effect). So, in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73\/173\/EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline, it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti's solvent and varnish business. A member state could \"not rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails.\" Second, a citizen or company can invoke a Directive, not just in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems, on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required. Third, if a Directive gives expression to a \"general principle\" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non-state parties before its deadline for implementation. This follows from K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code \u00a7622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal. Ms K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Third, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers.

The clinical significance of fruit peeling on bg or glucose detection is only beginning to be studied, but most of them found no relationship.1\u20135 This may be explained by using different protocols and analytical methods, different subject populations, different laboratory environments, and different analysis techniques. In the general population, blood sugar level ( bg ) readings have been measured using multiple approaches including glucose meter readings, finger stick tests with blood glucose measurements, and capillary blood glucose monitoring ( CGM ).6\u20138 These techniques may differ with respect to the frequency of handling the fruit (ie, once\/week) and therefore, may result in differences in the amount of bg detected, with differences ranging from as low as <3 points to as high as >5 points.5,9\u201311 Studies have also tested the effect of peeling on the appearance of sugar glucose ( bg ); however, these studies reported similar results to those from other studies.8,10\n\nA growing number of studies are investigating the effect of hand contact on capillary glucose concentrations, to evaluate if fruit peeling is related to a greater glucose level.

{"text":"The company has published accounts for last year showing an overall loss of $7.2bn. The company's results also included an impairment charge of $14.8bn reflecting the decreased value of its assets. Petrobras has been embroiled in a massive corruption scandal in which it is alleged that bribes were paid for lucrative contracts with the firm. The scandal has hurt Petrobras and damaged President Dilma Rousseff's government. In March hundreds of thousands of Brazilians protested against President Rousseff, who chaired the board of Petrobras for much of the period when the alleged bribes happened. However, the president denies involvement and has been exonerated by an investigation by the attorney general. More than 40 top politicians - including the presidents of both houses of Congress - are still under investigation, and the treasurer of the country's ruling party has been arrested. Earlier on Thursday a judge convicted a former Petrobras executive of money laundering and racketeering for his role in the case, that involved bribes and illegal donations to political parties. Paulo Roberto Costa, who was head of refining and supply, will serve part of his sentence under house arrest. He can still appeal. Petrobras was supposed to be Brazil's \"lottery ticket\" - as it is sitting on top of one of the world's most valuable oil reserves. But today it announced losses of $7bn for 2014 - its first loss in decades. That number is based on witness statements to the police that 3% of each major contract between 2004 and 2012 was paid in kickbacks to politicians and executives. Wednesday's announcement was highly anticipated in Brazil and in the markets, because previous figures were discredited. Petrobras executives - all recently appointed to replace people involved in the scandal - hope this will draw a line, and that the company may finally start to move on. Petrobras's oil bonanza: Blessing or curse? Back in November Petrobras's auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) declined to certify the company's accounts saying that the corruption scandal made it hard to value the firm's assets. Since then PwC has been able to calculate the impact of corruption and also identified other costs including those related to missed production targets and the lower price of crude oil. Publishing the results \"is a fundamental step toward fully salvaging the company's credibility,\" said Aldemir Bendine, the firm's new chief executive. But analysts say that the company will have to work hard to regain the trust of the financial markets. \"Petrobras's problem isn't about oil or finance, it's about trust. The first thing the company needs to do is recover its credibility, because today the market doesn't believe it,\" said Daniel Marques, chief analyst at consulting firm Gradual Investimentos.

Derry will host 140 events during the year - including the Turner Prize and the Royal Ballet's first visit to Northern Ireland for 20 years. Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the award was \"a precious gift for the peacemakers\" in Northern Ireland. Organiser Martin Bradley said: \"The way that Derry-Londonderry has come together as a team to ensure that the full potential of 2013 is realised has been truly remarkable and will ensure the maximum possible benefits for all the people of the city.\" \"As the first winners of this prestigious title, we have been pioneers, working without a blueprint and setting benchmarks for future UK cities of culture.\" The excitement began in July 2010 when the city was awarded the title ahead of rival bids from Birmingham, Norwich, and Sheffield. Actor James Nesbitt is chancellor of the University of Ulster, which has the Magee campus in the city. He said: \"This decision confirms what many of us in the province and further afield have known for many years - that Derry-Londonderry is a cultural powerhouse. \"Whether it is writers like Seamus Heaney and Seamus Deane, songwriters and performers like Phil Coulter or the Undertones, artists like Willie Doherty, film-makers like Margo Harkin and Tom Collins, or actors like Amanda Burton, Roma Downey and Bronagh Gallagher, the city has asserted a huge influence on the arts internationally.\" Television producer and writer Phil Redmond, who headed the UK City Of Culture judging panel, said the award was \"a cultural tool to bring people together\". \"When people read Derry's bid... it's about acknowledging the past, not shying away from the past, and using that point that the past informs our present and helps shape our future,\" he said. \"If that is not the role of culture then I don't know what is.\" The year will open with a Sons and Daughters concert on 20 January 2013 in a new, purpose-built venue in Ebrington Square. The aim of the concert is to celebrate Derry's rich musical heritage. It will be broadcast by the BBC. The Turner Prize will also be staged in the former barracks on Ebrington Square. It will be the first time the prestigious art competition has been held outside England. Playwright Brian Friel and actor Stephen Rea will return to the city with the Field Day theatre company, which was founded in the city in 1980. They will present a new work by playwright Sam Shepard.

Moreover, UPEC has developed complex mechanisms for adhering to and invading host cells, as well as evading immune responses. Its virulence factors include adhesins, toxins, invasins, lipopolysaccharides, and iron acquisition systems. One of its most important adhesins is type 1 fimbriae, which allow UPEC to adhere to and colonize the bladder epithelium. Another important adhesin is P fimbriae, which have a high affinity for globoseries glycolipids and are associated with pyelonephritis. UPEC can also produce toxins such as hemolysin, cytotoxic necrotizing factor, and \u03b1-hemolysin, which can damage host cells and induce inflammation. Furthermore, UPEC can invade host cells and form intracellular bacterial communities that are resistant to antibiotics and host immune responses. Overall, the pathogenesis of UPEC involves a complex interplay between the virulence factors of the bacteria and the host inflammatory responses. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for the development of effective therapies and vaccines.","prompt_len":621.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1653}

{"text":"Louis XIV gained the throne in 1643 and acted increasingly aggressively to force the Huguenots to convert. At first he sent missionaries, backed by a fund to financially reward converts to Catholicism. Then he imposed penalties, closed Huguenot schools and excluded them from favored professions. In 1685, Louis XIV took his efforts to the extreme by issuing the Edict of Fontainebleau, also known as the Edict of Revocation. This edict revoked the Edict of Nantes, which had granted religious tolerance to Huguenots, and banned Protestantism altogether in France. The edict ordered the destruction of Huguenot churches and the closing of Protestant schools. Huguenots were forbidden from emigrating and were denied the right to worship in private, under penalty of imprisonment, torture, or even death.\n\nThe revocation of the Edict of Nantes led to a mass exodus of Huguenots from France, with estimates ranging from 200,000 to 500,000 people leaving the country. Many of these refugees went to Protestant countries such as England, the Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland, where they were welcomed as skilled artisans, professionals, and entrepreneurs.\n\nThe expulsion of the Huguenots dealt a severe blow to the French economy, culture, and society, as many of the most talented and productive members of the population left the country. The loss of the Huguenots' skills and talents was felt for generations, and it contributed to France's decline as a leading European power in the 18th century.\n\nThe persecution of the Huguenots also had a lasting impact on French attitudes towards religious tolerance and human rights. It showed the dangers of religious intolerance and the need for the protection of individual freedoms, regardless of one's religious beliefs.

To achieve energy concentration, we need to optimize the QLCT basis functions using the quaternionic prolate spheroidal wave functions as a basis. We propose a method to calculate the QLCT of a 2D hypercomplex signal using the QPSWFs as a basis. This method is based on the fact that the QPSWFs have the property of being simultaneously concentrated both in 2D space and in the QLCT domain. We demonstrate numerically that this method provides better energy concentration compared to the existing methods.\n\nFurthermore, we show that the QPSWFs are also useful for analyzing the sparsity of 2D hypercomplex signals in the QLCT domain. We propose a sparsity measure based on the l_1-norm of the QLCT coefficients of a signal with respect to the QPSWF basis. We demonstrate numerically that this sparsity measure can be used to effectively identify the important features of a signal in the QLCT domain.\n\nOverall, our work provides a new perspective on the energy concentration and sparsity of 2D hypercomplex signals in the QLCT domain using the QPSWF basis.

The Indonesia visit is part of a month-long Asia tour for the king, that includes Malaysia, Brunei, Japan, China and the Maldives. After attending bilateral meeting in Jakarta, King Salman flew to Bali on Saturday, on six Boeing planes and one Hercules. In Bali, the king plans to spend nine days in a luxury resort, where he will be accompanied by an entourage of over 1,000 people, including family members, government officials and security personnel. The visit has been hailed as a boost for the Indonesian tourism industry, which has been struggling since a series of terrorist attacks in 2002 and 2005.\n\nHowever, the visit has also drawn criticism from some quarters, who argue that it is a clear example of Indonesia's subservience to Saudi Arabia. The country has been accused of pandering to the demands of the oil-rich kingdom, with some activists pointing out that the Indonesian government has granted extensive concessions to Saudi companies in recent years. Others have questioned the wisdom of hosting such a large entourage, at a time when Bali is already grappling with overcrowding and environmental concerns.\n\nDespite these concerns, many Indonesians have welcomed the king's visit, viewing it as a sign of the country's growing importance on the international stage. Some have also expressed hope that the visit will lead to increased investment and trade between Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, which could bring much-needed jobs and economic growth to the country.\n\nOverall, the king's visit to Indonesia is seen as a complex and multifaceted event, which reflects the evolving nature of relations between these two nations. It remains to be seen how this visit will play out in the long term, and whether it will ultimately bring benefits or drawbacks to the people of Indonesia.","prompt_len":357.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1902}

Turns out it's way too sleazy for its own good, or bad, or whatever. There's a problem- and one can see this also in the Italian sexploitation flick Porno Holocaust, similar to this in many respects- in not having balance to the sex and violence. Instead, the movie is just a series of gratuitous sex scenes that are more awkward than erotic, interspersed with bland dialogue and occasional attempts at horror. The violence is almost an afterthought, with a few brief scenes that feel tacked on rather than integral to the plot. And while the penetrator is certainly weird, he's also just kind of dull.

Bugs plays the role of cool manipulator while Elmer, as always, is the befuddled dupe. Part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that Daffy and Elmer pose so little threat to Bugs that he is basically just kicking back and having some easy laughs. Elmer falls into every trap that is laid for him but it is poor old Daffy who comes off worst, being shot in the face again and again, his beak ending up in more and more ridiculous positions.

{"text":"A response to previous comments made by residents of the region where this motion picture was lensed: One person suggested that the closing and destruction of the Ocean View Amusement Park led to a downturn in the surrounding neighborhoods. This is simply not true. Prior to the construction of Interstate 64, which bypasses the Ocean View area, the primary route for traffic went through the heart of Ocean View. Once the interstate was completed, Ocean View rapidly became a ghost town with businesses closing up and an increase in crime. This led to a huge reduction in revenues for the park, which also faced new competition from nearby Busch Gardens in Williamsburg. Meanwhile, in the past few years, the City of Norfolk has done a remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area has become a sought-after location for construction of high-end housing.<br \/><br \/>It has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film \"\"Rollercoaster\"\". This is also untrue. Footage was shot of two coaster cars careening off the ride for that film, but the actual explosions and collapse are exclusive to \"\"Death of Ocean View Park\"\".<br \/><br \/>As to the film itself, the storyline of a \"\"supernatural\"\" force in the water adjacent to the park was certainly silly, but somewhat typical for B-grade movies of the time. With the cast involved, there should be no surprise that the scenery was gnawed in almost every scene by the primary actors. I don't believe this film was intended to be another \"\"Citizen Kane\"\"; I believe Playboy was experimenting with a new non-nude format to determine if this was an area for the company to expand into (apparently not!). A strange force in the water causing strange events in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the conference table, but proved unmanageable in execution. The roller coaster and the rest of the park was destined for the wrecking ball anyway; \"\"let's come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise!\"\".<br \/><br \/>For the casual movie viewer, this would be a \"\"see once and forget about it\"\" film (except for Diana Canova fans); but for the thousands of people who live in the region and have fond memories of the park, this movie is like a \"\"walk down memory lane\"\" for footage of the park as well as old footage of downtown Norfolk, the first \"\"Harborfest\"\", and Old Dominion University.

Even though his ideas came close to reality - as in the opening scene where the camera pans into a small classroom to film a child playing with a simple toy - they never truly became so. It's a fascinating look at modern times and where we're heading, but it never manages to offer up an ideal vision.

The Labor Department regulates wages along with workplace safety. Mr Puzder has criticised a new Labor Department rule aimed at extending overtime pay to more than four million US workers. He has also dismissed a nationwide campaign by fast-food workers for a $15 minimum wage, more than double the current federal level.

Sir William Gull, \"physician in ordinary\" to Queen Victoria, and Dr Thomas Barnardo were prime suspects, and there were advocates for Montague John Druitt, a barrister (he was from a respected medical family and may have passed himself off as a doctor); a Dr Stanley (he may have been fictitious); the Polish Dr George Chapman (real name Severin Klosowski); and the Russian Dr Alexander Pedachenko.5\u20137 Nor has conclusive evidence been found for Gaylord Sundheim (a psychotic who had studied medicine) being the \"mad butcher\" of Cleveland, Ohio, in the 1930s.8 Summary points Arguably medicine has thrown up more serial killers than all the other professions put togetherThe medical profession seems to attract some people with a pathological interest in the power of life and deathDoctors have been responsible for killing not only patients and strangers but members of their own familyThe political killers par excellence were the Nazi doctors and the Japanese doctors engaged in biological warfareThe power of life and death Yet there are enough recorded instances of multiple murders by doctors (real or bogus) to make at least a prima facie case that the profession attracts some people with a pathological interest in the power of life and death. It is important to distinguish these kinds of murders from murders of ordinary people. These murderers are not all physicians. In the US, there have been cases where police murdered strangers, but no serial killers to come out of the medical school. In England, as a rule, nobody has ever taken the lives of patients, but it does seem that doctors and psychiatrists have the highest rates of committing murder than any other medical profession.\n\nHistorically, only the members of the medical profession have been convicted for murder, yet many of them became involved in serial killing before or shortly after their conviction.9 This indicates that some physicians may have had an attraction to power and the challenge of power rather than for the right to commit murder.

The purpose of this study is to provide an accurate growth assessment tool for veterinarians and horse owners to monitor the growth progress of Japanese thoroughbred horses. By taking into account the seasonal compensatory growth, the percentile growth curves will provide a more reliable and comprehensive evaluation of the horse's growth status.\n\nTo develop the percentile growth curves adapted for Japanese thoroughbreds, the researchers used z-scores based on the horse's height and weight measurements at various ages. These z-scores were then used to calculate the percentiles for each measurement, which were plotted to create the growth curves.\n\nThe study found that the developed growth curves accurately represented the growth patterns of Japanese thoroughbred horses, which often experience significant weight gain during the compensatory growth period. By using these growth curves, veterinarians and horse owners can identify possible growth abnormalities and take necessary steps to improve the horse's health and development.\n\nOverall, the development of these percentile growth curves provides a valuable tool for assessing the growth progress of Japanese thoroughbred horses.

Mr Grainger, a father of two from Bolton, had been under surveillance by GMP as part of Operation Shire before he was shot by Q9 through the windscreen of a stolen Audi in a car park. Inquiry counsel Jason Beer said Q9 was in one of three armed response vehicles deployed to arrest Mr Grainger and two others. Q9 said in a statement he was covering the occupants of the Audi from the rear window a police car and, as it was driven across the front of the stolen vehicle, he shouted \"armed police, show me your hands\". He said the driver - Mr Grainger - and the front-seat passenger, who were both wearing gloves, \"raised their hands above the vehicle's dashboard\". But he said Mr Grainger then lowered his right hand in a \"sudden and deliberate movement\". \"I thought he was reaching for a firearm. I quickly realised the approaching officers were in extreme danger,\" he said. He said he fired one round at Mr Grainger's chest and saw him slump back in the seat.

Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats, including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues. Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's. Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran, a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is an Arab, largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy. In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year.

So, in Francovich v Italy, the Italian government had failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent, as the Insolvency Protection Directive required. Francovich, the former employee of a bankrupt Venetian firm, was therefore allowed to claim 6 million Lira from the Italian government in damages for his loss.

The move was welcomed by some, including business groups who argued that a sudden hike to $14 an hour would have serious adverse effects on their operations. Ontario Chamber of Commerce CEO Allan O'Dette said that indexing the minimum wage to inflation \"provides businesses with additional predictability, allowing them to plan more effectively for the future.\" However, anti-poverty activists and labour groups criticized the move as insufficient, arguing that a minimum wage of $11 still leaves workers below the poverty line. Ontario Federation of Labour President Sid Ryan said, \"they've basically kicked the can down the road on poverty\" while Deena Ladd, co-ordinator of the Worker's Action Centre, argued that tying future increases to inflation would do little to improve the position of vulnerable workers. \"Indexing the minimum wage to inflation won't lift anyone out of poverty, but it will maintain workers in poverty,\" she said.","prompt_len":1011.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1953}

He also believes Australian business needs to play a bigger role in investment, particularly infrastructure.\"We're in a low-interest-rate, low-growth world but we haven't quite yet seen the same calibration of investor expectations on hurdle rates,\" he said.That's true.But in questioning the efficacy of RBA rate cuts, in saying he doesn't think further cuts will do terribly much for the economy, and in offering nothing concrete as an alternative other than fiscal consolidation, the treasurer risks leaving Australia with a policy gap.Read the full story in the Australian Financial Review.NOW WATCH: Money & Markets videosBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.

Within the course of that trial, Brigham Young stands up to tell of his conversion to Mormonism, and of his belief in the spiritual message of Smith. Then Smith is assassinated, and Young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the Mormons to a new land.

But the rules committee did approve a compromise measure that binds some superdelegates to the results of their state primaries.The debate over the first amendment, which failed 108 to 58, pit insurgent Sanders backers against the party establishment.Advocates of the amendment argued that it would make the presidential selection process more democratic, ensuring that all presidential delegates are elected by popular vote. Opponents of the amendment argued that the superdelegate system ensured a greater diversity of voices and that there should be more deliberation before it is changed.\"It's been stated that if this resolution were adopted that it would pit elected officials or politicians against community activists who would be vying to become delegates to the convention,\" said former Cook County Commissioner Chuy Garcia, an amendment backer. \"As a politician and as a community activist in my community, all I can say is this is a silly argument to make!\"Garcia was referring to an argument first raised in a Congressional Black Caucus letter sent in June where the lawmakers argued that they preferred the superdelegate system because it allowed them to evade \"the burdensome necessity of competing against constituents for the honor of representing the state during the nominating process.\"\"I am fully aware of those who have concerns with the superdelegate process.

The inspiration for the imposing monument came from barricades used by rebels in besieged eastern Aleppo, made out of upturned buses which shielded people against the snipers of President Bashar al-Assad. Thirty-two-year-old Syrian-German artist Manaf Halbouni told the DPA news agency that the monument is intended to represent \"peace, freedom and humanity\". \"There is no other political message,\" he said. \"It's a peace memorial, a modern Statue of Liberty.\" He said the point of the sculpture was to inspire hope - in Dresden and Aleppo - while making the point that \"life goes on, despite all the destruction\".

The Albanians, feeling betrayed by the Normans, refused to aid them in battle and were left to face the Byzantine army alone.

The company's use of the technology is not without controversy, however. Some critics have raised concerns about the ethical implications of charging different prices based on weather conditions and demand. Others have asked whether this technology could lead to discrimination, as certain neighborhoods and demographics may be more affected by extreme temperatures than others.\n\nCoca-Cola Co. has defended its use of the technology, saying that it is simply responding to market forces and increasing demand for its products during hot weather. The company has emphasized that customers always have the option to choose a different beverage or wait until prices return to normal. In addition, the company says it has implemented safeguards to ensure that the vending machines do not discriminate on the basis of race, gender, or socioeconomic status.\n\nDespite these assurances, some consumers remain skeptical.

{"text":"we study the ground state phase diagram of the bilayer heisenberg model on square lattice with a bosonic rvb wave function . the wave function has the form of a gutzwiller projected schwinger boson mean field ground state and involves two variational parameters . Our investigation into the ground state phase diagram reveals that the bilayer Heisenberg model on the square lattice with a bosonic RVB wave function undergoes a transition from a disordered spin liquid state to an antiferromagnetic state as the interlayer coupling J' increases. The transition point is estimated using variational Monte Carlo simulations, which provide an excellent agreement with previous results obtained by other methods.\n\nFurthermore, we find that the nature of the ground state depends on the values of the two variational parameters in the wave function. At small J', the ground state is characterized by short-ranged spin correlations and a finite (yet suppressed) spin gap. As J' increases, the spin correlations become long ranged and the spin gap disappears, indicating the onset of antiferromagnetism. The critical point where the spin gap closes is found to be sensitive to the values of the variational parameters.\n\nOverall, our results provide a detailed understanding of the ground state phase diagram of the bilayer Heisenberg model on the square lattice with a bosonic RVB wave function, shedding light on the interplay between spin liquid and antiferromagnetic behavior in this system. We anticipate that our findings will facilitate further experimental and theoretical efforts towards elucidating the rich physics of quantum magnetism in frustrated systems.","prompt_len":263.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1660}

Jacoby is able to pull all of these aspects of Hamlet's character together with the aid of Shakespeare's full script.<br \/><br \/>Why does Hamlet not kill Claudius immediately? Hamlet says \"\"I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious...\"\" Hamlet is extremely upset, not only for his father's death (and suspected murder), or his mother's marriage to his uncle, but also, and mostly, because Claudius has usurped the throne belonging to Hamlet. He is furious at his mother for marrying Claudius (marriages between royal kin is not unknown; done for political reasons) but that her marriage solidified Claudius' claim to the throne before he could return from Wittenburg to claim it for himself. He is, therefore, impotent to do anything about it. And this is true even after he hears his father's ghost cry vengeance. He cannot simply kill the King or he will lose the throne in doing so.

Furthermore, our model predicts the presence of polarization swings in the pulsar's emission. We suggest that these swings are caused by the rotation of the pulsar's magnetosphere, which produces a changing geometry of the emission region. This interpretation is supported by observations of other pulsars that exhibit similar polarization swing behavior.\n\nIn addition, our model explains the unusual behavior of psr j0540 - 6919 in X-rays. Unlike most pulsars, this object does not show a pronounced X-ray pulse. Instead, the X-ray emission appears to be relatively constant over the pulsar's rotation period. We propose that this behavior is due to the complex geometry of the pulsar's magnetosphere, which causes the X-ray emission to be emitted from a wide range of angles.\n\nOverall, our theoretical interpretation of psr j0540 - 6919 provides new insights into the nature of pulsar emission and the underlying physics of pulsar magnetospheres.

Locals have also reportedly been forced to participate by putting posters and decorations on important buildings. The fall of Mosul came as a shock to many and prompted the jihadist group to launch an offensive that saw it seize swathes of Iraq. More on this story: Inside Mosul: Life under IS control On the front line in battle for Mosul Footage reveals IS regime in Mosul What has happened since the fall of Mosul? Despite facing 10 months of air strikes by a US-led international coalition and attacks on the ground by Iraqi government forces, IS has maintained its grip on the territory and been free to impose its extreme interpretation of Islamic law. On Tuesday, the Iraqi satellite channel al-Sumariyah TV cited a local official in Mosul as saying that IS was expected to hold a \"victory\" celebration at the former five-star Nineveh Hotel, which has been taken over by the group. There were unconfirmed reports that IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi would make an appearance or issue a recorded message to mark the occasion, al-Sumariyah added. Last July, Baghdadi delivered a sermon at Mosul's Great Mosque in which he urged Muslims to emigrate to IS territory in order to carry out a war for the faith against unbelievers. It came days after IS formally declared the establishment of a \"caliphate\" headed by Baghdadi. Sources in Mosul told the BBC that IS militants were also undergoing training in the streets on Tuesday in preparation for a government offensive. Mosul had been expected to become the focus of a lengthy campaign after the government recaptured the northern city of Tikrit in early April. But US officials said the fall of the western city of Ramadi to IS last month meant it was likely to be delayed, possibly until 2016, the New York Times reported. The Mosul operation depends on the success of US efforts to retrain the Iraqi army, whose soldiers fled Ramadi despite vastly outnumbering the IS militants attacking.

{"text":"Vanguard safety addresses investor concerns that holding all their investments at Vanguard, an investment management company, may put their life's savings at risk.Vanguard (and every other US-regulated mutual fund company) does not hold funds directly. Funds are held by 3rd party custodians.Investors who remain uncomfortable holding all of their assets in Vanguard may hold their funds with alternative custodians.What if Vanguard went broke?The following explanation was posted by Mel Lindauer:[1]\"This is a very serious and timely issue, so I'll address it to hopefully set everyone at ease.First, The Vanguard Group Inc. (VGI) is actually a subsidiary of the various mutual funds, each of which is a separate legal entity. The best way to describe Vanguard's unique structure would be to think of General Motors turned upside down, with Chevrolet, Cadillac, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, etc. as the corporate parents, and General Motors as a subsidiary. If you think of Chevrolet, Cadillac, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and the other GM divisions as mutual funds, and General Motors (the subsidiary, in this situation) as Vanguard Group Inc., you'll get the picture.Since VGI is actually owned and funded by the various mutual funds,[notes 1] for all practical purposes, it won't go bankrupt unless all of the various mutual funds that support it went bankrupt. The only way that could happen would be for the value of all of the stocks and\/or bonds held by each and every individual Vanguard mutual fund to go to zero. So, forget about Vanguard going bankrupt -- it just isn't going to happen.It's also important to point out that even if VGI were to somehow go broke, VGI has no recourse to the assets of the funds. Rather, each fund's custodian holds that fund's assets. Even the fund managers do not have custody of their fund's holdings. They simply decide which stocks\/bonds to sell, and the custodian actually delivers (in the case of a sale) or takes delivery (in the case of a purchase) of the actual asset.Another huge and very important difference between Vanguard's mutual funds and the Enrons and WorldComs of the world is that Vanguard is required to \"mark to market\" (value each fund share based on the value of all of the fund's holdings) each day the market is open. That keeps the fund's books current. This \"marking to market\" pricing is subject to both routine and spot audits by both the SEC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking.One major reason for the lack of problems with mutual funds comes from the fact that they're regulated by the Investment Company Act of 1940, which spells out the legal responsibilities of the mutual funds to their investors. In addition to the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the SEC also directly regulates mutual funds. While the SEC can investigate fraud allegations against investors at public companies like Enron and WorldCom, where the accounting is much more complex than at mutual funds, it has no authority to set corporate governance rules for these public companies. These are huge differences.Keep in mind, too, that, despite all of this, if something were","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":3133}

{"text":"Often rules apply to all goods neutrally, but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products. For such \"indirect\" discriminatory (or \"indistinctly applicable\") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \"mandatory\" or \"overriding\" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \"considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view\" and labelling would protect consumers \"just as effectively\". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \"chocolate\". It had to be \"chocolate substitute\". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A \u2018neutral and objective statement\u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \"a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers\" that \"affects the access of that product to the market\". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement.","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":3089}

{"text":"Donald Pleasance and Peter Cushing united in one horror film; that always sounds like a terrific plan. Two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation, who previously already starred together in terrific genre outings like \"\"The Flesh and the Fiends\"\" and \"\"From Beyond the Grave\"\", pairing up in a mid-70's satanic themed exploitation flick. How can this possibly go wrong? Well, unfortunately, it can. To my deepest regret \"\"Land of the Minotaur\"\" can hardly even be called mediocre, and that in spite of the cast, the exotic setting, the appealing title and the potentially great sounding premise. In a remote little area in Greece, more particularly near an archaeological site, multiple tourists vanish because Baron Peter Cushing and his docile followers keep feeding them to a fire-breathing Minotaur statue. Cushing, who never looked more bored and uninterested in any role he played before, owns a giant medieval castle and apparently in Greek this means you also own the complementary archaeological ruins and an underground network of caverns. That is of course quite handy if your hobby is the kidnapping of random campers and amateur archaeologists. When three of his young friends also mysteriously disappear in the same area, Father Roch - the priest of a couple of towns before) - decides to investigate. \"\"Land of the Minotaur\"\" is a boring and extremely slow-paced horror effort that never really undertakes any major attempts to generate a satanic atmosphere and doesn't bother to elaborate on all the potentially fascinating elements and pagan trivia details. The titular Minotaur, for example, is an intriguing creature of Greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person, but for some inexplicable reason the script never deepens out the significance. Instead, the film focuses on tedious and overly talkative sequences and loud inappropriate music altered with experimental noises. The only reason to even consider giving this major disappointment of a film a chance is because of Donald Pleasance. His portrayal of rude, bossy and old-fashioned priest who criticizes everything that represents modern youth is powerful and reliable as always.\"","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":2193}

He was inspired by views of the Sound of Sleat and also of Skye, which lies across the stretch of sea. An arts symposium and exhibition at the college runs from Friday to Sunday. Called An Linne: Echoes, Reflections and Transfigurations, the events mark the centenary of the artist's birth in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1916. The painter, who served as a navigator on US bombers flown out of England during World War Two, moved to Mallaig in 1957 and he continued to visit and work in the village in the north-west Highlands throughout his career. Many of his pieces were influenced by the changing weather on the west coast and the effect the conditions had on the sea. Magda Salvesen, curator of the Jon Schueler Estate, said: \"The Sound of Sleat became to Schueler a place of experience, memory and mood. \"The specificity of this body of water fed Schueler's paintings - their imagery enlarged through layers of memory. \"How appropriate and challenging that the symposium celebrating the artist's centenary should be held on Skye, an island seen through changing weather from his studio in Mallaig.\" The celebration at SMO - Scotland's National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture, and which offers a Jon Schueler Residency scholarship - includes talks on Schueler's life and work and an exhibition of selected pieces from his time in Mallaig. Donnie Munro, director of development, fundraising and the arts at SMO, described the artist as having a \"profoundly deep experiential affinity with the Sound of Sleat\".

That is, they impart magnetic character to oxygen when it is in the presence of a magnetic field, because of the spin magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons in the molecule, and the negative exchange energy between neighboring O 2 molecules.\n\n\"The main reason for this paramagnetic character of oxycarbons is the fact that they have only one electron in their outermost orbit,\" said first author Fumiaki Hata, who holds appointments in the Department of Physics and the School of Earth and Environment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"This is essentially an electron orbit with four electrons rather than the two usual electron orbits.

As noted in his initial recruitment report, Logan Cudgelurdge was born physically weak and very clumsy. Through his current training, he is no longer weak, and is indeed tough and slow to tire, there is still much improvement to be made in order to shape Logan into the perfect super-soldier.About two months ago I called together the great minds of the fortress, setting up a meeting in the library to brainstorm ways to effectively raise Logan's physical and mental conditioning. One scholar brought to my attention that Swimming increases all combat-related attributes except toughness. He advocated a design involving minecarts to simulate the movement of a dwarf while swimming, speeding up the learning process exponentially. Of course, he doesn't know about the classified Dwarven Super Soldier Project, and the fact that our trainee in question is 8 years old and, while probably perfectly capable of pushing the minecart all by himself, is too light to trigger the Dwarven impulse ramps and cannot use this method. However, swimming did seem to be a great way to raise the attributes of young Logan with 0 risk of losing such an asset to a freak accident. Even better, Logan already had novice skill in swimming, meaning that he wouldn't have to be taught the basics.I immediately ordered the construction of a fully-automated facility for training swimming After a month, the construction is fully complete:Pictured Above: Bottom Level of the Conditioning ChamberOn the top level, a pressure plate attached to a retracting bridge means that Logan will walk over the plate and onto the bridge, get dropped into the pool, have to swim his way out of the chamber, and repeat the process as he crosses the bridge again.Logan goes through this course non-stop for a month. Each time, he improves his swimming technique, and the strain of the constant training makes him harder, better, faster, and stronger. Finally, after this month of training, Logan comes out, thirsty as hell, with a Grandmaster skill level in swimming. Examination by our medical dwarves indicate that Logan is now at peak physical condition, being mighty, absolutely inexhaustible, and agile. His toughness is still not at optimum level, however. This can only be increased through combat.Now that Logan has been fully conditioned, it is now time to return Logan to the old Agoge methods of combat training: setting him loose amongst enemies, for a no-holds-barred beatdown.

Furthermore, understanding the mechanical variables involved in LESS can help in developing optimal surgical techniques and reducing patient morbidity. Some of the mechanical factors that can affect LESS outcomes include instrument design, force application, tissue interaction, and trocar placement. \n\nThe analysis of mechanical measurements in LESS involves the use of various tools and techniques such as force sensors, kinematic analysis, finite element analysis, and virtual reality simulations. Force sensors are used to measure the forces exerted by the surgeon during LESS procedures, which can help in developing ergonomic instruments and reducing surgeon fatigue. Kinematic analysis involves the use of motion tracking sensors to measure the movement of instruments and tissues during surgery, which can help in developing new surgical techniques and improving surgical outcomes.\n\nFinite element analysis is a mathematical method used to analyze the mechanical behavior of tissues and instruments during surgery. This technique can help in predicting the stress and strain distribution in tissues, optimizing instrument design, and reducing tissue trauma.

{"text":"The pictures show the swirling clouds of the gas giant at both its poles - views that no previous mission has managed to acquire in such detail. Juno captured the data last weekend as it made its first close approach to the planet since going into orbit in July. The flyby took the spacecraft just 4,200km above Jupiter's multi-coloured atmosphere. The 6MB of data downlinked to Earth from the encounter is still being analysed, but principal investigator Scott Bolton said new things were already obvious. \"First glimpse of Jupiter's north pole, and it looks like nothing we have seen or imagined before. It's bluer in colour up there than other parts of the planet, and there are a lot of storms,\" the Southwest Research Institute scientist explained in a Nasa statement. \"There is no sign of the latitudinal bands or zones and belts that we are used to - this image is hardly recognisable as Jupiter. \"We're seeing signs that the clouds have shadows, possibly indicating that the clouds are at a higher altitude than other features.\" Jonathan Nichols from the University of Leicester, UK, is a member of the Juno mission's science team. He told the BBC that his colleagues were bowled over when they first saw the pictures: \"The team's reaction was amazement. 'Look at these images; they are coming from Jupiter; we're flying over the pole for the first time!' It's just jaw-dropping.\" When the Juno probe arrived at Jupiter in July, its instruments and camera were switched off. It had to perform a critical rocket manoeuvre to get into orbit - and engineers did not want the complication of taking pretty pictures at the same time. But after successfully turning around the planet, Juno booted up its other systems, and last Saturday's return pass was the first opportunity to get a good look at the gaseous world. The probe's Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper (JIRAM) has acquired unique views of Jupiter's southern aurora. Earth telescopes have tried but failed to get such images. And Juno's Radio\/Plasma Wave Experiment (Waves) has recorded the blizzard of particles moving through the planet's super-strong magnetic field. Juno's quest is to investigate the secrets of the Solar System by explaining the origin and evolution of its biggest planet. The spacecraft's remote sensing instruments will look down into the giant's many layers and measure their composition, temperature, motion and other properties. We should finally discover whether Jupiter has a solid core or if its gas merely compresses to an ever denser state all the way to the centre. We will also get new information on the famous Great Red Spot - the colossal storm that has raged on Jupiter for hundreds of years. Juno will tell us how deep its roots go. And Dr Nichols said Jupiter was a wonderful laboratory to try to understand even more distant places. \"We can go to Jupiter and kick the tyres to see how it works, but that then gives us some insights on lots of other objects in the Universe. \"We can use Jupiter as an analogue for things like brown dwarfs and exoplanets - basically, any fast-rotating body with a magnetic field can be modelled in some way like Jupiter.\" The spacecraft is currently flying on an ellipse around Jupiter that takes 53 days to complete. Its next close approach is due on 19 October, when the probe will fire its main engine to tighten the circuit to just 14 days. This configuration will then be held until February 2018 when the spacecraft will be commanded to make a destructive dive into Jupiter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s atmosphere.

First, consider the Old Testament: Exodus 21:23 gives a picture of God executing those who commit adultery or murder or lie: \"But if you commit adultery and do not expect to yourself be killed, and you commit murder with a weapon: then you shall be put to death and be killed.\" So clearly, God was not impartial in executing those who did not receive Him.

{"text":"To make new legislation, TFEU article 294 defines the \"ordinary legislative procedure\" that applies for most EU acts. The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council. Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the \"competence\" to define the EU's \"competence\".

The concept was intriguing - a woman named Marie appears to live two separate lives, one as a successful New York literary agent and the other as a French widow with two children.

{"text":"So, is this announcement pure politics? After all, George Osborne knows that the first rule of political strategy is to \"define your opponent before they can define themselves\". By announcing this now but delaying a vote on it until the Autumn he is ensuring that the argument about spending will dominate the Labour leadership campaign and that the new Labour leader will have to decide whether to vote for or against balancing the books. This, though, is about more than merely wrong-footing Ed Miliband's successor. Osborne is trying to alter the rules of the political game permanently - or, as Gordon Brown would have put it, to create a new consensus. He wants running permanent deficits to be as politically unthinkable as pledging to scrap the minimum wage or oppose gay rights. However, don't allow all this politics to distract from an important economic debate about whether it is sensible prudence or ideological madness for a government to balance the books. After all, many of us borrow to invest ie we have a mortgage to buy our houses and governments can borrow more easily and more cheaply than individuals so why shouldn't they do the same ie borrow, even in good times, to build houses, roads or hospitals? What's more borrowing can, many economists argue, increase the rate of growth and, therefore, cut deficits and debt faster than aiming to do so by cutting spending. Whoever is right, many in politics now see the argument for more rules to limit politicians' freedom to act irresponsibly and less discretion for them. Not so long ago ministers could rig interest rates for political reasons. They could tell the Bank of England what to do. They could alter economic forecasts to make themselves look better. The independence of the Bank of England and the creation of the Office for Budget Responsibility have out paid to all that.

{"text":"we review the physics of heavy quark and quarkonium production in high energy hadronic collisions . Heavy quarks, such as charm and bottom quarks, are produced in high energy hadronic collisions through a variety of mechanisms. The dominant mechanism for producing heavy quarks is gluon fusion, where a gluon from one hadron interacts with a quark from the other hadron to create the heavy quark. Other mechanisms include quark-antiquark annihilation and the fragmentation of a gluon into a heavy quark-antiquark pair.\n\nQuarkonium, on the other hand, refers to bound states of heavy quarks, such as charmonium (J\/psi) and bottomonium (Upsilon). Because of their heavy mass and small size, quarkonium states provide a unique probe of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy ion collisions.\n\nTo understand the production of heavy quarks and quarkonium in high energy hadronic collisions, we use perturbative QCD calculations in which the strong interaction is described by Feynman diagrams. These calculations are done in terms of parton distribution functions (PDFs), which describe the probability of finding a parton (quark or gluon) with a certain momentum fraction inside a hadron.\n\nOverall, the study of heavy quark and quarkonium production in hadronic collisions is important for understanding the fundamental properties of the strong force and the behavior of matter at extreme temperatures and densities.","prompt_len":99.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1429}

{"text":"Strings and RepresentationsHello. My name is Austin Bingham, and welcome to the fifth module of Python: Beyond the Basics. In this module we'll look at string representations of objects in Python, and in particular we'll cover the important, but often confused differences between repr() and str(). Understanding and properly using the various string representations in Python is important for writing maintainable, debuggable, and human-friendly programs. In this module we'll show you what you need to know to use them properly. As you already know, Python supports two primary ways of making string representations of objects, the function's repr() and str(). Each of these can take any object as an argument and produce a string representation of some form. These two functions rely on the special methods dunder-repr and dunder-str to generate the strings they produce, and it's possible for class designers to control these string representations by defining those functions. Here's a quick example. Here the class Point2D defines both dunder-str, which returns a simple format, and dunder-repr, which returns a more complete unambiguous format. If we print both string representations, we can see how the free functions str() and repr() use these methods. So, the big question is why are there two representations, and what are they used for?Implementing CollectionsHello. My name is Robert Smallshire. Welcome to the ninth module of the Python: Beyond the Basics course where we'll demonstrate how to go beyond the built-in collection types by creating your own collections. In our Python Fundamentals course we showed how the different built-in collections can be categorized according to which protocols they support. In this module we'll build a new and fully functioning collection type of our own design. This will require us to implement a series of different protocols, each of which represents a different capability of collections. The protocols we'll cover are the Container Protocol, which allows us to test for item membership in a collection; the Sized Protocol, which allows us to determine the number of items in a collection; the Iterable Protocol, which we encountered in an earlier module of this course; here we'll utilize that knowledge directly; the Sequence Protocol, which supports random read access to collections; and the Set Protocol, which supports various set operations. There are many further protocols for different collections, which we won't cover here, but we'll give you a good grounding in how to implement protocols so you can build on the foundations we provide.","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":2609}

We also take into account the theoretical uncertainties in the hadronic matrix elements and the form factors involved in these processes. Our analysis shows that the experimental data on the radiative decays impose strong constraints on the parameter space of the aligned two-higgs-doublet model. In particular, the limits on the relevant Yukawa couplings obtained from the decays to the @xmath1 mesons restrict the allowed regions where the CP violation effects can be significant. Moreover, we compare our results with the constraints from other low-energy observables, such as the @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays, and conclude that the combination of all these data provides a powerful tool to test and constrain the extended Higgs sector in the context of new physics beyond the standard model.","prompt_len":556.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1350}

Respectable opinion knows which side wears the black hats in this conflict.What is it about Israel that arouses so much anger? Is it because it's a theocratic state, committed to destroying its neighbour, which uses civilians as human shields, tortures and kills its political opponents, persecutes homosexuals, and holds freedom of speech and the rule of law in contempt?No, hang on, that's Hamas, and we all know they're the good guys of the piece. No matter how appallingly they treat their own people and how many innocents they blow up, shoot or kidnap, nothing can blot their copybook.Which isn't to say that Israel could get away with the same behaviour, of course.

{"text":"If you keep rigid historical perspective out of it, this film is actually quite entertaining. It's got action, adventure and romance, and one of the premiere casting match-ups of the era with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the lead roles. As evident on this board, the picture doesn't pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling. To get beyond that, one need only put aside the history book, and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. I know, I know, that's hard to do when you consider Custer's Last Stand at the Little Big Horn and it's prominence in the history of post Civil War America. So I guess there's an unresolved quandary with the picture, no matter how you look at it.<br \/><br \/>There's a lot to take in here though for the picture's two hour plus run time. Custer's arrival at West Point is probably the first head scratcher, riding up as he does in full military regalia. The practical joke by Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) putting him up in the Major's headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble.<br \/><br \/>Ironically, a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy, as in Custer's first meeting with Libby Bacon, and subsequent encounters that include tea reader Callie (Hattie McDaniel). I hadn't noticed it before in other films, but McDaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the Forties, Mantan Moreland. So much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been Moreland hamming it up in a dress. With that in mind, the owl scene was a hoot too.<br \/><br \/>As for Flynn, it's interesting to note that a year earlier, he portrayed J.E.B. Stuart opposite Ronald Reagan's depiction of General Custer in \"\"Santa Fe Trail\"\", both vying for the attention of none other than Olivia de Havilland. In that film, Reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of Custer that history remembers, while in Flynn's portrayal here it's more than evident. But it doesn't come close to that of Richard Mulligan's take on the military hero in 1970's \"\"Little Big Man\"\". Let's just say that one was a bit over the top.<br \/><br \/>The better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which Custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture. That and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story. Most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival Sharp just before riding into the Little Big Horn, in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on one's point of view. Earlier, a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into Custer's character, when he stated - \"\"You take glory with you when it's your time to go\"\".\"","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":2830}

Big managers, big players on the pitch, big crowds, it's exactly what we want. \"We've got good players - good players who work their socks off - and we want to learn from today and get better and better with each game.\" Reading boss Jaap Stam: \"In the first half we played very well. We had good possession, generated a number of chances and scored two good goals. \"We dominated with 11 men on the pitch, but obviously after Garath got sent off it was a totally different game. We decided to play a 4-4-1 system that allowed us to defend against Barnsley, who are a side with real quality. \"Sometimes maybe we got a bit lucky, but we worked very hard and didn't give many clear-cut chances away. \"Of course, Garath knows what he's done and does feel guilty because he was playing a fantastic game until then, but I think you have to question whether something like that can't just see a yellow card given. \"We are building a certain team with a certain style of play and defending is definitely an aspect of that.

To account for the possibility of nodes leaving a social network, we introduce birth and death processes into the model. Birth and death processes capture the natural turnover of individuals within a network, and provide a more realistic framework for modeling social networks.\n\nRecruitment in this model is driven by the presence of recruiting nodes, which are able to convert susceptible nodes into members of the recruiting class. However, not all nodes are susceptible to recruitment, and only those nodes that meet certain criteria are able to be recruited.\n\nWe use this model to explore the effects of different recruitment strategies on the growth and stability of social networks. By varying the frequency and intensity of recruitment, we are able to investigate how different recruitment strategies impact the overall structure of the network and the rate of turnover within the network.\n\nOur results suggest that recruitment can have a significant impact on the growth and stability of a social network. Specifically, we find that networks with high rates of recruitment tend to be more dynamic and exhibit faster turnover, while networks with lower rates of recruitment are more stable and tend to exhibit slower turnover. These findings have important implications for understanding the evolution and dynamics of social networks in a variety of different contexts.","prompt_len":288.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1665}

The results showed significant variation among the lines for each trait, indicating the presence of genetic diversity in the population. Through a genome-wide association study approach, we identified several qtls associated with the taste of cooked rice, and some of these were found to be co-localized with previously reported qtls for grain quality traits. Based on the analysis of the growth characteristics and physicochemical properties, we selected a few promising lines that exhibited desirable traits for further evaluation and varietal development.

She switches between first and third person perspectives without warning or reason, which just ends up being confusing. Additionally, the pacing is inconsistent and disjointed. Some scenes are rushed and others drag on for far too long.Overall, I found the characters to be flat and uninteresting. The protagonist lacked depth and the supporting cast were forgettable. Their dialogue was stilted and unnatural, making it difficult to connect with them or care about their fates.However, I will say that the world-building was impressive. Bailey clearly put a lot of thought into the history and culture of this fictional universe.

{"text":"The problem for party leaders is a simple matter of arithmetic. There are already six formally announced candidates - Cruz, Paul, Rubio, Fiorina, Carson and Huckabee. By the early June, four more will have joined the race - Santorum, Pataki, Perry and Graham. The end of June could see four or five more - Jindal, Bush, Walker, Kasich and Christie. That's 15 candidates - not including real estate mogul Donald Trump. A debate with that many participants would either take all day or reduce the speakers to the shortest of soundbites. It's a situation British party and media officials grappled with earlier this year, when deciding who would be included in their general election debates. Those left out, such as Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, vociferously complained. Even during the Republican primary debates four years ago, with at most \"only\" nine entrants at a time, the proceedings risked becoming an out-of-control circus act, with candidates at one point asked to respond to questions with a show of hands. Recently word leaked out that the Republican Party was recommending that media debate sponsors limit participation to a maximum of 12 candidates. That set off a round of nail-biting, hair-pulling and rampant speculation about who would, or wouldn't, make the cut when the first event rolls around in Cleveland on 6 August. \"How do you pull off a nationally televised debate with more than a dozen announced candidates when the usual barriers to entry that winnow the field of contenders could do more harm than good?\" asks the Washington Examiner's David M Drucker. The challenge is that the field is chock full of high-profile politicians who hold - or recently held - major offices. Could a sitting governor or senator be left on the sidelines? If not, that already puts the total at nine - and doesn't include the only woman, Carly Fiorina, and one of the two minorities, Ben Carson. What about poll numbers? In the past, debates have been limited to only those who poll at 1% or above nationally. According to the latest Fox News survey, however, 14 candidates hit that mark - including six who aren't current officeholders. Move the bar up a couple of points and you reduce the number to nine - but you exclude Ohio Governor John Kasich, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, recent Texas Governor Rick Perry and 2012 runner-up Rick Santorum, among others\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and keep Mr Trump on the podium. Other ideas floated by party insiders include the ranking of candidates by the number of staffers they have hired in early voting states or the amount of small-donor money they've raised for their campaigns. All this has prompted some wags and political operatives to come up with innovative ways to cull the herd. According to multiple media reports, Mr Jindal's supporters are suggesting breaking the field into two randomly selected groups and holding back-to-back debates. There are drawbacks to that idea, of course. \"Only the hardest of hardcore political junkies will sit through two nights of political chatter, so whoever ends up in Group B will end up whining that Group A had a larger audience,\" Allahpundit of the conservative HotAir blog writes. He suggests having a tournament-style debate format. Give the five most prominent candidates - Bush, Walker, Rubio, Paul and Cruz - a \"bye\", with the remaining presidential hopefuls battling it out in early-round debates. The winners get to take on the heavyweights. \"If this process is going to be a circus, it at least ought to be fun,\" he writes. Liberal commentator Bill Scher wholeheartedly endorses the idea of fundraising prowess as the sole means of judging candidates. What, he asks, could be a better embodiment of conservative values? \"Democrats awkwardly lament the money chase while trying to master the race course, whereas Republicans have proudly equated campaign cash with the First Amendment,\" he writes. \"All Republicans have to do is follow their own logic, and their debate conundrum will be resolved. Just let those with the most money have the most speech.\" Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, on the other hand, thinks all this winnowing is a bad idea. He suggests a four-hour-long debating marathon with a few five-minute bathroom breaks scattered in. \"They will get huge ratings,\" he said. \"No one's going to rush, no one's going to feel like they've got to get their time in, as opposed to the classic 90 minutes.\" Then again, maybe axing the bathroom breaks would get even more viewers watching. Make each candidate drink a tall glass of water before the start, and those who can hold out till the end are invited to the next debate. Call it Battle of the Bladders. It's the kind of reality television modern audiences crave. ","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":4738}

Virgin Media and other broadband ISPs wanted to block the Sky channel on cable TV but BSkyB claimed that was unreasonable and that other firms should also be blocked if customers wanted a Sky channel.

{"text":"Diabetes Type 3\u2014which is regarded as \"brain\" specific diabetes\u2014is a dangerous diabetes hybrid that was first discovered in 2005. A study, which was conducted at Brown University Medical School, suggests the brain produces insulin in a way that's similar to the pancreas. A problem with insulin production in the brain is thought to result in the formation of protein \"plaque\"\u2014not unlike that which is found among suffers of Type 1 (insulin-dependant) and Type 2 diabetes (insulin-resistant). But in the case of diabetes Type 3, plaque appears in the brain and leads to memory loss and problems forming memories.What HappensWhen it comes to the body, insulin is responsible for helping to convert food to energy. The brain uses insulin, too, but it's thought insulin's primary purpose in the brain is to form memories at synapses (the spaces where cells in the brain communicate), notes Time.com. Neurons save space for insulin receptors; insulin makes way for memories to form. In order for the brain to keep making more brain cells, it needs insulin. When insulin receptors flee\u2014as is the case with sufferers of diabetes Type 3\u2014the brain does not receive the energy it needs to form memories.Alzheimer's ConnectionAccording to a research team at Northwestern University, insulin may prevent or slow memory loss among those with Alzheimer's disease by protecting the synapses that form memory. Those with the disease tend to have lower insulin levels and are insulin-resistant. The team found that the reason memory fails when insulin shortage occurs is because amyloid beta-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) destroy the receptors in the brain that typically are reserved for insulin, thus making the receptors insulin-resistant. Without the space for insulin, receptors cannot connect, and memory loss occurs.Possible Cholesterol ConnectionAccording to the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, there may be a link between cholesterol and cognitive decline among Alzheimer's patients taking lipid-lowering drugs. French researchers note taking certain cholesterol-lowering drugs may result in a slower progression of Alzheimer's disease. It's thought statins could play a role in keeping Alzheimer's disease from progressing.Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes ConnectionThe American Diabetes Association notes that there isn't a \"standard definition\" for diabetes Type 3, though it's sometimes called \"double diabetes\" because it has been used to describe those with Type 1 diabetes who additionally shows signs of insulin resistance (the major symptom of Type 2 diabetes). Type 3 diabetes also has been used to describe those with Type 1 diabetes who become insulin-resistant over time. In some cases, taking insulin-sensitizing drugs may be beneficial.Symptoms of Insulin Function ProblemsWhen insulin function goes awry, a number of symptoms may occur. Some of the most common ones include cravings for carbohydrates and sugars\u2014such as cookies, chips and crackers\u2014and feeling \"out of it\" or fatigued in the late afternoon. Weight gain in the middle of the body also is common, according to Kathleen Jade, ND.What Comes NextDiabetes Type 3 is not completely understood. Diagnosis and treatments remain in the early stages, and mores studies are required in order to fully understand how to help those with diabetes Type 3\u2014as well as its","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":3345}

But archaeologists have warned the plans would cause irreversible damage. Farmer Rachel Hosier said if the scheme were to go ahead it would leave her \"heartbroken\". The western end of the tunnel is due to emerge close to Bush Barrow, which is on Mrs Hosier's land. Bush Barrow is an ancient burial site. When it was excavated in 1808 gold items were found alongside the body of a \"stout and tall man\". The body is still buried there, surrounded by dozens of other barrows, and is referred to as Bush Barrow Man. Mrs Hosier's great-grandfather bought the 1,300-acre farm in the 1950s. She has stopped farming on part of the land because of the \"significant archaeology\" there. She said she felt \"very upset\" about the planned road. \"I think it's so important that enough consideration is given as to sensitively putting this road in the environment. \"It's got to be sensitive. Not in front of Bush Barrow man,\" she said. Earlier this month, a group of 21 archaeologists said there would be a \"destructive impact\" from the tunnel. A body that advises World Heritage Site group Unesco has also objected to the idea. Highways England's Andrew Alcorn said it would have to work \"very carefully to sort out the setting and placement\" of the western end of the tunnel. \"We're listening to what she [Mrs Hosier] is saying, we're listening to the other 9,000 pieces of correspondence we've had,\" he said. The tunnel could be one of 16 national schemes that the National Audit Office (NAO) has said does not offer \"value for money\".

{"text":"Toronto, Ontario, September 3, 2017 \u2014A new Ipsos poll for Global News has found that more than half (54%) of Canadian parents agree (15% strongly\/39% somewhat) that the cost of their kids' activities puts a strain on their family's finances. Indeed, the strain is enough to put some families in the red: more than one in four (27%) agree (5% strongly\/21% somewhat) they've gone into debt to finance their children's activities.The poll reveals that during the past school year, parents who spent money on extra-curricular activities for their kids spent an average of $1,120 to enroll their children in extra-curricular, community and sports activities. For some, last year's price tag was even higher: nearly one in ten parents (9%) spent upwards of $2,000. This financial burden is especially felt among lower-income families. The poll found that parents earning less than $50,000 a year were more likely to agree that the cost of their children's activities puts a strain on their finances (63% compared to 50% of those earning over $50,000). This highlights a potential barrier for children from low-income families to participate in extra-curricular activities, which can have a positive impact on their social and academic development. \n\nFurthermore, the poll also revealed that parents who are single, separated, or divorced were more likely to go into debt to finance their children's activities (41% compared to 23% of those who are married or living with a partner). This suggests that the financial strain of extra-curricular activities can exacerbate the challenges faced by single parents in providing for their children. \n\nAs extra-curricular activities become increasingly important for children's growth and development, it is evident that something needs to be done to alleviate the financial burden on families. This may involve government subsidies for low-income families or community fundraising initiatives to support those in need. Ultimately, it is crucial that all children, regardless of their family's financial situation, have access to the same opportunities for growth and success.","prompt_len":758.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":2111}

{"text":"This could be seen as a pivotal weekend in the title pursuit and certainly for the top four, with a six-point gap between Manchester City in fourth and fifth-placed Manchester United, despite a second successive home defeat for Manuel Pellegrini's side. So is the top four now a closed shop, especially given United manager Louis van Gaal's admission that the Europa League is their best chance of reaching the Champions League? And what shape are the top four currently in? Form: The Foxes were seconds away from a point that would have seemed like a victory at Arsenal - achieved with a numerical disadvantage after Danny Simpson's sending off and would have completed a haul of four points from away fixtures against the Gunners and Manchester City. Instead, Danny Welbeck's late winner changed the landscape but, as Foxes manager Claudio Ranieri pointed out, if they had said before they would pick up two points from those games that would have looked good. We have seen the brilliance of Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, but Sunday was a day that demonstrated they can dig in and have character and guts all over the field, with midfield man N'Golo Kante and keeper Kasper Schmeichel outstanding. Six points from a home game against Liverpool and these two tough away fixtures is an excellent tally and, despite the loss, there was nothing at Arsenal to suggest they cannot recover. Momentum: Still plenty and when they face Norwich City next at the King Power Stadium in front of their own fervent fans, you would back them to get back to winning ways. Fixtures are also acceptable too - they have already played their six fixtures against the other teams in the top four and have a return of eight points. Momentum still intact and nothing to fear in the weeks ahead. X Factor? X Factors for and against here. Who knows how Leicester will react to a painful defeat, or the growing recognition that they can no longer hide beneath the radar or play down their chances? And of course there is always the worry of injuries (longer-term at least) to Vardy, Mahrez or Kante. These are the unknowns - but even in defeat at Arsenal this was a Leicester City team that was rich in strength and team spirit. They play without fear and it will serve them well. Statistically speaking: Leicester City have lost just three Premier League games this season, but two of those have come against Arsenal. The run-in: Points collected against the teams to play again this season: Total - 32 points Verdict: Leicester City are still top by two points, have favourable looking fixtures and their players will come back refreshed after a week's holiday given as a reward for their efforts by Ranieri. The pressure will increase now but they have shown nothing to suggest they are going away - Leicester City will be in this until the end. Form: Outstanding - and backed up by a real statement of a victory at Manchester City. The doubters, many of them Spurs fans, always look for the soft underbelly, the weakness at the pinch point - not on Sunday at the Etihad. Yes, they carried luck with the penalty decision but they also showed strength of character to come back and secure the win after Manchester City's equaliser. This is the sign of a strong team going places. Analysis: Spirit, fitness and belief - why Spurs can win title Listen: Ramon Vega - \"I have no doubts Spurs will grab the league\" Big players such as Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen are performing, as well as the outstanding Dele Alli - but in so many respects the key figure at Spurs is manager Mauricio Pochettino. The 43-year-old Argentine, in his second season at White Hart Lane, has this Spurs team playing exactly as he wants them. They pressurise opponents, look so solid at the back and have players who can make a difference in attacking positions. Looking the full package. Spurs have the best defensive record in the Premier League, conceding only 20, and are third in the goal charts, behind Leicester and Manchester City who have 48, with 47. Momentum: Will pick up with that win at Manchester City - and that is five league wins in a row since they lost 1-0 at home to Leicester. How big is that north London derby going to be when they face Arsenal at White Hart Lane on Saturday, 5 March? They still have to visit Liverpool and Chelsea along the way but no terrors for a team in this form. X Factor? Again similar to Leicester City. How will they cope with the hope and expectation of a fanbase that have not sampled a title since 1961? And how would they handle an injury to someone like Kane? Pochettino also carries weighty responsibility - but he looks such a safe pair of hands. Statistically speaking: Tottenham have won five consecutive Premier League games for the first time since a run of six in December 2011. The run-in: Points collected against the teams to play again this season: 18 points Verdict: The rising anticipation among Spurs supporters that the long wait may finally be over is fully justified. This is a team that have lost only once away from home in the league this season, on the opening day at Manchester United, and look solid as a rock. This is as good a title chance as Spurs have had in recent memory. Form: Picking up - and it needed to. Arsenal had suffered an indifferent couple of results at home when they lost to Chelsea and were held to a goalless draw by Southampton. Arsene Wenger's side needed to answer back and they have done so with victory at Bournemouth and showing great persistence and character to break through Leicester's blue wall of defiance. It was required because old questions were being asked about the Gunners and their character. Now they can clear their heads and move forward. Momentum: Regained with these recent wins and must now be maintained through a couple of tough away fixtures on the horizon at Manchester United - always difficult despite their struggles - and that fixture of huge significance at Spurs. Wenger felt they passed a mental test against Leicester and there was a sense that the wind was back in their sails. X Factor? Same as ever - will the pressure of not winning a title since the season of 'The Invincibles' in 2003-04 engulf them, as it has seemed to do so often before? If they can conquer that, and come through those hazardous away fixtures unscathed, then supporters who have so often been disappointed by their team's title challenges in recent years can really believe. The calming influence of keeper Petr Cech, a four-time title winner at Chelsea, cannot be underestimated. They must not lose him. Statistically speaking: Arsenal have kept five clean sheets in their last eight Premier League games. The run-in: Points collected against the teams to play again this season: 29 points Verdict: Will never have a better chance to reclaim the title that has eluded them for 12 years. If they blow it the recriminations will be loud and long. Form: Bad. It's been a desperate eight days for Manuel Pellegrini's side. Two home defeats by title rivals Leicester and Spurs have left them off the pace and struggling to regain the title they have won twice in recent years. It is made all the more frustrating by the fact this is a team full of talent who too often look off the pace - and are clearly capable of better. They do, however, have the capability to string together a winning sequence and this may yet be their saving grace. One telling factor should be a cause for concern. In five games against the other teams around them in the top four, they have only gained one point from an away draw at Leicester. Momentum: Currently being lost - but this team are so enigmatic it can be regained just as quickly. They would have expected six points from these two important home games. To come away empty-handed is simply not good enough. City still have to visit Chelsea and Liverpool and have a home derby with Manchester United on 20 March - and there could yet be a defining meeting with Arsenal at the Etihad on Saturday, 7 May. First, however, they will have to make sure they are still in the race. X Factor? Has the confirmation of Pep Guardiola's arrival next season had an impact on Manchester City's players? The feeling here is that it has not but he will certainly cast a shadow if they continue to lose games. They have lost both since that appointment was rubber-stamped. City also have a heavy programme to deal with, with an FA Cup fifth round tie at Chelsea next Sunday followed by a Champions League last 16 game against Dynamo Kiev in Ukraine - with the matter of a Capital One Cup final against Liverpool at Wembley to consider at the end of February. Statistically speaking: Manchester City have won just one of their 10 Premier League games against sides currently in the top eight this season, losing six and drawing three. The run-in: Points collected against the teams to play again this season: 23 points Verdict: City have now pushed themselves into the position of title outsiders with these two losses and for a team with so many outstanding players they too often look uninspired and short of drive and energy. Still capable of winning the title - but chances are receding on current evidence. ","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":9199}

{"text":"summarybackgroundreconstruction of the pharynx and cervical esophagus has significantly progressed in the last 2 decades . Advancements in surgical techniques have made it possible to treat patients with complex pharyngeal and esophageal defects. Reconstruction of these structures is essential to restore normal swallowing function and prevent aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, and dehydration. The use of free tissue transfer, such as radial forearm flap, anterolateral thigh flap, and jejunal flap, has become more common and has shown promising results. These techniques allow for more complex and extensive reconstruction, making it possible to restore swallowing function in patients who would have otherwise been relegated to a lifetime of enteral feeding. In addition, the use of 3D-printing technology has facilitated the creation of patient-specific implants and scaffolds to aid in the reconstruction process. This has significantly improved the success rate of reconstructive surgeries and reduced the risk of complications. Despite these advancements, the functional outcomes of reconstruction are still highly dependent on a patient's preoperative swallowing function, comorbidities, and treatment history. Therefore, a multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment approach is still required for the successful management of these patients.","prompt_len":122.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1354}

{"text":"sustained asset deflation, and the liquidity trap is the steep, long-term appreciation of the yen relative to the dollar. As companies in Japan struggle to compete with cheaper prices from countries with weaker currencies, their profits and investments decrease. This leads to even further pressure on the economy and causes a downward spiral. The central bank has attempted to intervene by implementing negative interest rates and increasing monetary stimulus, but the impact has been limited.\n\nThe appreciation of the yen also creates a liquidity trap, as the demand for safe-haven currencies increases. This decreases the effectiveness of monetary policy in stimulating growth, as the markets become flooded with cash. As a result, the government may need to focus on fiscal policy, such as increased public spending and tax cuts, to boost the economy.\n\nOverall, the sustained asset deflation and appreciation of the yen are complex issues that require a multi-faceted approach from the government and central bank.

{"text":"This is the most common method of construction procurement and is well established and recognized. In a traditional procurement approach, the client or project owner would first hire an architect or a design team to create a detailed design for the project. Once the design is completed, the project owner would then put the project out to tender to interested parties, such as contractors or construction companies, who would submit bids for the project. The owner would then evaluate the bids and award the contract to the contractor who provides the best value.\n\nUnder this method, the contractor takes on full responsibility for the construction of the project, including procurement of materials, hiring of labor, and meeting the project timeline and budget. Any changes to the project during the construction phase must be approved by the owner and the contractor would be responsible for implementing the changes.\n\nThe traditional procurement method is beneficial for clients who want a level of control over the design process, as they have direct input into the selection of the design team. Additionally, the method allows for more accurate budget forecasting since the project cost is determined before construction begins. However, it may result in higher overall project costs as there may be less collaboration between the design team and the contractor, leading to potential design and construction issues that can delay the project.\n\nOverall, the traditional procurement method has been tried and tested over time and remains a reliable approach for construction projects.

{"text":"dynamical properties of a lennard - jones binary mixture embedded in an off lattice matrix of soft spheres are studied in the direct space upon supercooling by molecular dynamics simulations . on lowering temperature the smaller particles tend to avoid the soft sphere interfaces and correspondingly their mobility decreases below the one of the larger particles . This results in the emergence of a clear size dependence of the diffusion coefficients of the two particle species. Furthermore, the diffusion of both particle species is observed to become increasingly heterogeneous as the system is supercooled. The diffusive behavior of the mixture is found to be influenced by the degree of glassiness of the surrounding matrix, with a higher degree of glassiness leading to a stronger cage effect and consequently slower diffusion. These findings provide insights into the dynamical behavior of binary mixtures in complex environments, with potential applications in materials science and biophysics. Further studies are needed to investigate the effect of different soft sphere properties and matrix geometries on the diffusive behavior of binary mixtures.","prompt_len":364.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1160}

In the aftermath, England's feudal system was dismantled and a new democracy was established. A major part of that democracy involved the power of the king, which was challenged in the 15th century once again when Edward III married a French princess named Margaret of Anjou, who was not British. (See the map here for the location of historical battles.)\n\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Angevin Dynasty, which had ruled over western Europe since Edward the Confessor returned Wales to its original inhabitants, the old feudal system was reintroduced. In the Westphalian language, meaning \"rule of lords,\" the right of the king to rule depended on the lords he had vassals over. Each feudal lord retained his own castle and held the right to rule his territory as long as he paid a tax from the revenues. As he couldn't own the land, a castle didn't necessarily mean he was king. So after the breakdown of the Angevin system and the creation of a monarchy, the idea of an earl became an important position. It was the king's right to appoint and remove the head of the earldom.\n\n\nBut as England began to grow politically with new nobles and aristocrats emerging from poverty and the spread of Christianity in the country, a new idea of class emerged: that of the \"city-bred\" aristocrat with many families living in the same city.

Patients with a history of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, or renal events were included in the cohort of patients with an elevated risk of these events. Overall, 219 elderly patients and 232 high-risk patients were included in the analysis. The results showed that adverse events were infrequent and generally mild in both cohorts. Only one elderly patient and two high-risk patients experienced severe adverse events, all of which were unrelated to the use of DSG. The most commonly reported adverse events were application site reactions, which occurred in 6.8% of patients in the elderly cohort and 4.3% of patients in the high-risk cohort. In conclusion, this analysis suggests that DSG is a well-tolerated treatment option for elderly patients and those at an elevated risk of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, or renal adverse events.","prompt_len":717.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1717}

For the initial testing ( Figure 3, bottom left panel) we compared the effects of white light vs. a full white background on the intensity of white light\u2010induced pupil density gradients within the focal plane. We also compared the effects of white light vs. a full black background on the intensity of black background\u2010induced pupil density gradients. We chose these two conditions due to the widely accepted use of white light as the primary tool in the treatment of hyperopic visual symptoms. Results demonstrated that subjects with focal eyes treated with white light exhibited no significant pupil dilation under either condition. However, pupils exhibited a significantly greater dilatation under the black background condition.\n\nThe results of this study are clear and stark. The effects of white light on the pupil appear to stop at the level of the light itself. In other words, when the light itself is sufficient to induce pupil dilation in normal individuals (i.e. it does not exceed the pupil size limit), it is effectively absent. On the flip side, the same is true of black. The effects are most notable at high light levels and when the light source is not diffuse (i.e. not white). We conclude that although the effects of light are evident, they are largely the product of the pupil dilation itself and do not necessarily provide any additional benefit beyond what is experienced","prompt_len":171.0,"label":"gpt2","text_length":1568}

{"text":"My parents encouraged my curiosity about the world around me and understood why I couldn't resist dismantling things from an early age. They gave me a chemistry set one year, a magnetism kit the next. I have always been interested in how things work. Like many people I was inspired by a great teacher - in my case a super science teacher when I was 10. He used to bring everyday gadgets to our lessons and explain the physics of how they worked. I went on to study maths and then moved into engineering to work on noise reduction - my PhD project was on reducing the noise levels of Concorde. I have enjoyed a wonderful career in engineering, at the University of Cambridge, working with some of the brightest people in the country on projects ranging from silent aircraft to low-emission power plants. Young children are, as I was, natural engineers, constantly seeking to understand the properties of materials as they engage with the world around them. When the cardboard structure they have built is strong enough to support the weight of other toys and becomes a medieval castle, there is the thrill of persistent and successful improvement. We must find ways to encourage experimentation in an age where our education system has a tendency to expect young people to move away from practical learning as they grow up and to become more theoretical and abstract. Why does this matter? Because we have a major skills shortage - by 2022 the UK will need at least 1.82 million new engineering, science and technology professionals. We need to inspire many more young people to take up careers in these crucial areas, which will pave the way for our future economic development. Engineering and science are evolving all the time. Many of the jobs we will need in 20 years' time have not been invented yet, just as many of the jobs advertised today did not exist 20 years ago. The spread of mobile technology, the development of composite materials, the sequencing of the genome, the increasing demand for energy, and many other advances have created a huge variety of fascinating new jobs. However, there are too many people who think a career in these areas, particularly in engineering, is \"not for them\". Perhaps they don't know any engineers who they can ask about the field or they have set ideas about what they want to achieve and think engineering is not a job that will provide it. Girls in particular do not seem to think that engineering is a suitable career for them, despite their achievements in maths and science at school. It is very frustrating to be facing a shortage of engineering skills when so few women enter the profession. Only 7% of engineering professionals in the UK are female, and the proportion is even lower for engineering apprentices. This is why the Royal Academy of Engineering has set up its Diversity Leadership Group to remove barriers and encourage more women and other under-represented groups into engineering - the Royal Society is providing a similar leadership role for the science community. The media also has an important role to play in breaking down stereotypes in the portrayal of engineers - we know this is a cultural and sociological issue in the UK, rather than a physiological problem, as there are much higher proportions of women practising as engineers in other countries. Proportion of women in engineering: Engineering graduates: 1984: 7% 2003\/04: 13.7% 2012\/13: 14.2% Engineering apprenticeships: 2011\/12: 3% Engineering employment (professionally registered): 2003: 2.26% 2013: 4.36% Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering: 2006: 2% 2014: 4% Source: Royal Academy of Engineering Too few girls take physics A-level - a major gateway to engineering. Physics is more popular with girls in girls-only schools, perhaps because they don't feel inhibited in taking physics. The statistics in mixed state schools are quite shocking - as many as half of them are not returning a single girl for A-level physics. Many schools are already well aware of the opportunities available and are actively encouraging and enabling their pupils to consider working in the sciences and in engineering. The Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering, of which I am a trustee, recently held an inspiring day with the Association of Girls' State Schools for 120 Year 11 girls to meet engineers from different companies and see first hand what they are working on. It is not just about A-levels and university pathways - technician-level skills are in equally high demand and yet can seem less aspirational to students. We need to tackle this culture and the Royal Academy of Engineering has led the way with initiatives such as the London Engineering Project, enabling students in some of London's most deprived schools to study the demanding new engineering diploma courses. Working with businesses, not-for-profit organisations and charities, the Tomorrow's Engineers programme runs industry visits, workshops, Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (Stem) Ambassador partnerships and careers resources, to help schools to incorporate engineering into their current curriculum. The annual Big Bang Fair has also started to open young minds to the opportunities in engineering and science - more than 75,000 young people are expected to visit the next one, in March 2015 at the NEC in Birmingham. Big Bang Fair gives young people a special insight into the people and processes behind today's amazing technologies. Without this understanding, they will not think \"that could be me\" when they see an engineer or scientist in person or on television. They will not pursue academic subjects that open the door to these careers, and they will miss out on the unique opportunities they can offer. They will also miss out on a lucrative career - engineering graduates are the third highest earners over their lifetimes of all subjects studied at university. Engineer Your Future, an exhibition that opened in December at the Science Museum, also aims to let young people in on the exciting world of modern engineering. Utilising the latest research, such as the Royal Academy of Engineering and Centre for Real World Learning's work on thinking like an engineer, the museum has worked with engineering companies across the UK to create an experience that will really challenge young people to think about their future. The exhibition is part of the government's Your Life campaign, which aims to increase the number of young people studying maths and physics and considering Stem careers. By giving visitors the chance to try \"thinking like an engineer\" through interactive games and exhibits, Engineer Your Future will make it easy for young people to see how their interests and strengths could play into an engineering career. Whether it's designing a planetary vehicle, or testing tsunami defences, whether it's developing prosthetic limbs, or making electricity available around the world, young people should have big dreams, and this exhibition will show them how they can be achieved.

{"text":"A B cell identifies pathogens when antibodies on its surface bind to a specific foreign antigen. This antigen\/antibody complex is taken up by the B cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides. The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides on its surface MHC class II molecules. The surface MHC II molecules, together with T cell recognition of foreign antigens presented in this manner, results in T cell stimulation. T cells are recruited to these sites, stimulate additional B cells to produce antibodies, and thus form a memory to the antigen of interest. These memory B cells remain in the circulatory system, where they are readily recruited during subsequent infections. In the case of infections with a pathogen of specific memory, the cells are quickly activated to form large numbers of antibodies, causing rapid onset of disease. On the other hand, if foreign antigens do not appear, memory cells that may otherwise be recruited to a site remain in the circulatory system. This allows the patient to mount a rapid tissue response at a later time when the antigen surfaces. In this way, antibodies allow a rapid response to specific antigens. The development of memory B cells is central to adaptive immunity. 33 Although this principle is not directly associated with the current discussion of T cell regulation, the discussion is included here to emphasize again the close relationship between humoral and cellular immunity.

{"text":"Robert Altman's downbeat, new-fangled western from Edmund Naughton's book \"\"McCabe\"\" was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following. The year is 1954, the stage is Los Angeles' Pasadena Playhouse, the main character, a small-time crook, is a high school senior named Jake LaMotta, who, despite his mother's best efforts, is a bully and knows no bounds. LaMotta steals from some local pawnbrokers and, in the course of a long night of drunken debauchery where he is threatened and beaten by some of his classmates, is eventually knocked unconscious by a drunken bully on the stage. In other words, Jake (and subsequent star Bruce Willis) are all about the drinking. The movie is so successful and so thoroughly embraced by the American public that the major studios were forced to take notice. Two years later, Warner Bros. released a musical version of this movie starring a more charismatic John Wayne as LaMotta. Since then, the movie has been revived in Broadway musical form several times and is one we can all relate to.In the case of \"McCabe,\" as well as its musical descendants, a lot was going on, from Bruce Willis's great role (at the time) to John Wayne's own involvement throughout the film's production. The producer of the musical was Frank Mancuso and the playwright was James L. Brooks. The story was inspired by a real-life incident that occurred on the LA studio lot in the late 1960s. The location for the production was in what was then the West Wing of Warner Bros.' Burbank lot - now the Warner Bros. lot (which is now the home of studio movie production, of which \"Batman v Superman\" is a prime example).

{"text":"A Pittsburgh federal judge dismissed the case \"with prejudice\" meaning it cannot be amended and refiled. Renita Hill filed the claim saying she had been \"emboldened\" by the actions of Mr Cosby's other alleged victims. Seven women are suing him, claiming he portrayed them as liars when they went public with their accusations. Mr Cosby filed a counterclaim, alleging their claims were only for financial gain. The 78-year-old is also seeking unspecified monetary damages and said the women inflicted emotional distress. Ms Hill's defamation case said she was made out to be a \"liar\" and \"extortionist\" when the comedian, his wife and his lawyer issued blanket denials. But judge Arthur Schwab agreed with Mr Cosby's legal representatives that the statements were opinions protected by the First Amendment. \"Even considering these three statements together as a combined, single statement, this newly 'conjoined' statement does not lead to an inference that the plaintiff is a 'liar and an extortionist',\" he said. Ms Hill's legal representative, George Kontos, said he would be appealing the decision, adding he strongly disagreed with the judge's reasoning. \"The basis of his opinion is these are constitutionally protected, 'pure' opinions,'' said Mr Kontos. \"But, looked at as a whole, they contain all sorts of innuendo and undisclosed facts.\" Mr Cosby has not responded specifically to Ms Hill's allegations that he drugged and assaulted her several times after they met on the TV show Picture Pages in 1983. She claims she was 16 at the time and the abuse continued for four years. She also says Mr Cosby helped pay for her college fees and travel to cities where he was performing.

{"text":"The UNHCR said this was the largest influx in such a short period since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011. The Syrian Kurds are fleeing an advance by Islamic State (IS) militants, who have seized swathes of Iraq and Syria in recent months. IS fighters are reported to be closing in on the Syrian town of Kobane. The capture of Kobane, also known as Ayn al-Arabon, would give the jihadists complete control of the area. Even before the latest influx, Turkey was struggling to cope with more than a million Syrian refugees who have crossed into its territory since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began more than three years ago. Carol Batchelor, the UNHCR's envoy in Turkey, told the BBC that such high numbers of refugees would place a strain on any host community. The sheer number of refugees would overwhelm any country. Added to that, they are Kurds from Syria, many of them deeply hostile to Turkey. For 30 years, Turkish forces fought Kurdish rebels in a civil war that killed 40,000 people. The fact that Turkey is accepting tens of thousands of Kurds is a sign of how allegiances are being forced to change with the onslaught of Islamic State. But deep-seated tension between Kurds and Turks have again come to the surface, leading to border clashes on Sunday. Turkey fears that Kurds will cross into Syria to join the Kurdish militia. The worry is that, renewed by fresh recruits, it could ally with the outlawed PKK and launch attacks on Turkish soil. All the regional complexities, added to the refugee influx, make for a precarious situation here. She called for \"increased solidarity and international assistance\" for those flooding across the border. \"The situation is deepening. It's becoming protracted. People are desperately in need,\" she added. Ms Batchelor said food, blankets and winter clothing - particularly for children - were needed. Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said his country was preparing for \"the worst case scenario\" - an influx of hundreds of thousands more refugees. \"I hope that we are not faced with a more populous refugee wave but if we are, we have taken precautions. If necessary, we have planned how to send these people to safer and further places,\" he said. Anwar Muslim, president of the Kobane regional government, told the BBC that Kurdish fighters had inflicted heavy casualties on IS and pushed the militants back. He accused the group of killing women, children and the elderly. \"All our ministers, like ordinary people, have picked up arms. Our people believe we can defeat IS. Our morale is high,\" he said. On Friday, Turkey opened a 30km (19 mile) section of its south-west border to Syrian Kurds fleeing Kobane. Clashes then broke out on Sunday after protests by Kurds on the Turkish side of the border, some waving banners of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The BBC's Mark Lowen, at the scene, said Turkish forces were trying to stop Kurdish fighters from entering Syria to take part in the defence of Kobane. By Monday only two out of nine border posts in the area remained open, the UNHCR said. Our correspondent says the Syrian conflict has reawakened old hostilities and shaken a fragile peace between Kurds and Turkish authorities. The PKK, a banned militant group that fought a civil war for autonomy within Turkey for decades, has called on Kurds to join the fight against IS. PKK-affiliated forces have been battling IS in northern Iraq for months. In other developments: The US has said it will attack the group in Syria, though so far it has carried out air strikes against IS only in Iraq. On Monday, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said France would not launch air strikes against IS in Syria despite having attacked the group in northern Iraq last week. Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair told the BBC on Sunday that air strikes alone might not be enough to contain the group. \"If necessary, we shouldn't rule out the use of, particularly, special force capabilities,\" he said. US President Barack Obama previously ruled out the involvement of US ground troops, and has instead promised to provide arms and training to local forces fighting against IS.

The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besan\u00e7on Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in \"a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy\"). Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party\", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise.

{"text":"His publicist Dick Guttman confirmed the death, saying: \"We are overcome with sadness.\" Landau won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1995 for portraying the horror movie star Bela Lugosi in Ed Wood. He died on Saturday in Los Angeles of \"unexpected complications\" following a hospital visit. Landau was born in New York and started out as a cartoonist for the New York Daily News before moving to theatre and then cinema acting. He featured in the Alfred Hitchcock film North by Northwest and played a commander in Space: 1999 and Geppetto in a live-action version of The Adventures of Pinocchio. But he turned down the role of Mr Spock in Star Trek, a role that went to his friend Leonard Nimoy instead. And Nimoy later replaced Landau on Mission: Impossible when the latter left following a dispute over pay. Many in Hollywood hit social media to pay tribute, including Star Trek actor William Shatner, who played the role of James T. Kirk. Brent Spiner, best known for his portrayal of Lieutenant Commander Data in the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation, tweeted: \"Great actor, Martin Landau leaves us at age 89. So glad the part of Lugosi came to him. He crushed it. RIP.\" Stranger Things actor David Harbour wrote: \"The great Martin Landau has died. Long time member of the actor's studio and brilliant craftsman in our tradition. I will miss his work.\" Ralph Macchio, who played Daniel LaRusso in the Karate Kid series, praised Landau's performance in the 1989 comedy drama Crimes and Misdemeanours. The film was written, directed by and co-starred Woody Allen and gave Landau his second Oscar nomination for best actor in a supporting role.

{"text":"I want very much to believe that the above quote (specifically, the English subtitle translation), which was actually written, not spoken, in a rejection letter a publisher sends to the protagonist, was meant to be self-referential in a tongue-in-cheek manner. But if so, director Leos Carax apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film. Instead, the actors play their roles with complete seriousness, and every moment of the film is imbued with a sense of melancholy and despair. This creates a jarring contrast with the supposed self-referential and humorous tone of the publisher's rejection letter. As the film progresses, it becomes clear that the protagonist is struggling not only with the rejection of his book, but with the larger question of his own identity and purpose in life. The rejection letter serves as a catalyst for his existential crisis, leading him on a journey of self-discovery and ultimately to a bittersweet resolution. Despite the initial confusion caused by the self-referential quote, the film ultimately proves to be a powerful and emotional exploration of the human condition.","prompt_len":365.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1136}

{"text":"Wealth concentration is a theoretical[according to whom?] process by which, under certain conditions, newly created wealth concentrates in the possession of already-wealthy individuals or entities. According to this theory, those who already hold wealth have the means to invest in new sources of creating wealth or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth, thus are the beneficiaries of the new wealth. This process can lead to an increasing gap between the wealthy and the rest of society, as those without access to wealth are unable to benefit from the new sources of wealth creation. Additionally, wealth concentration can lead to a concentration of power, as those with wealth are able to exert more control over political and economic systems.\n\nCritics of the wealth concentration theory argue that the evidence for it is mixed, and that there are many other factors that contribute to wealth inequality. They point to examples of self-made millionaires and billionaires who have started from humble beginnings and built their wealth through hard work and entrepreneurship.\n\nDespite this criticism, many economists and policymakers view wealth concentration as a serious issue that needs to be addressed. They argue that increasing economic inequality can lead to social and political instability, and that policies aimed at reducing wealth concentration can help promote a more equitable and sustainable economy.

It is the first official trip all four of the family have been on together. By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent Those who chronicle the lives of the Cambridges now know that balloons are the way to a 16-month-old princess's heart and Charlotte's first public utterance was to use the word \"pop\".

{"text":"everything in the universe is assumed to be compromised of pure reversible quantum toffoli gates , including empty space itself . empty space can be configured into photon or matter gates simply by swapping logic input information with these entities through the phenomenon of quantum mechanical entanglement between photons and empty space toffoli gates . the essential difference between empty space , photons and matter gates are the logic input values of their respective toffoli gates . This means that empty space gates have logic input of 0, while photon gates have logic input of 1 and matter gates have logic input of 2. The logic input values determine how the gates interact with each other and with external signals. For example, when a photon gate and an empty space gate interact, they can exchange information and change each other's logic states. This process is essential for the creation of particles and for the transfer of energy in the universe.\n\nFurthermore, the reversible nature of the quantum toffoli gates ensures that information and energy are conserved, and that the universe operates according to the laws of physics. The fact that empty space can be configured into photon and matter gates highlights the interconnected and dynamic nature of the universe. Everything is constantly changing and interacting with each other, and the smallest units of matter and energy are intimately linked to the structure of empty space itself.\n\nUnderstanding the role of quantum toffoli gates in the universe is crucial for advancing our knowledge of physics and for developing new technologies that can harness the power of quantum mechanics. With continued research, we may one day be able to manipulate these gates to create new materials, perform faster computations, and unlock the secrets of the universe.","prompt_len":491.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1827}

The patient was a 12-year-old male with no significant medical history. The nevus comedonicus syndrome was diagnosed based on clinical and radiological findings. The dermatological symptoms involved multiple open and closed comedones that had formed in the affected areas. The lesions were distributed over the trunk, arms, and legs, with no specific pattern.\n\nAdditionally, the patient had midline lesions on the lower abdomen and bilateral pinna. The skeletal system was also affected, with an adduction deformity involving bilateral metatarsal and medial deviation at the tarsometatarsal joint. X-rays revealed that the patient had a narrow tarsal canal.\n\nFurther, the patient had some unusual neurological and visceral symptoms. The patient had agenesis of corpus callosum with an interhemispheric cyst, which resulted in seizures and intellectual disability. The patient also had a pancreatic cyst, which was likely due to abnormal embryogenesis.\n\nThe patient's treatment plan involved surgical excision of the comedones and referral to a multidisciplinary team consisting of dermatologists, neurologists, and gastroenterologists. The patient required long-term anticonvulsant therapy to manage seizures and intellectual disability. The central nervous system malformation did not require immediate intervention, and the patient was advised to undergo regular imaging follow-up to monitor the cyst.\n\nIn conclusion, nevus comedonicus syndrome is a rare dermatological condition that can present with a range of symptoms involving multiple organ systems.

Regular imaging follow-up and appropriate therapy can help mitigate the long-term effects of the condition on the patient's quality of life.","prompt_len":530.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":2333}

Our analysis shows that the longitudinal mode contributes significantly to the thermodynamics at high energies and modifies the equation of state in a nontrivial manner. We calculate the thermodynamic quantities such as pressure, energy density, entropy density and sound velocity for the plasma and find that the presence of the longitudinal mode leads to a significant reduction in the sound velocity and a decrease in the speed of sound. These results have important implications for the phenomenology of the quark-gluon plasma, such as its cooling rate, viscosity and other transport properties.

{"text":"Speaking in front of an audience even came out higher than death in one survey with 41% naming it as the thing they were most afraid of. While the survey's results suggest public speaking was at that particular moment more on their minds than the more distant prospect of death, it shows how nervous it makes people. Jeannette Nelson, head of voice at the National Theatre and author of \"The Voice Exercise Book\",  says the non actors she works with are even afraid of rehearsing, with a lot of them frightened, \"really frightened\", to work with her. \"Your voice is incredibly personal. It carries your history as much as anything and once you start homing in on that people can be very defensive, quite self-conscious,\" she says. Regardless of how reluctant people are, public speaking is increasingly required in many jobs; whether it's presenting the results of a particular project, having to speak up in a large meeting, or giving a speech on an area you excel in. For those at the top, such as chief executives, it's essential, yet there's often little formal training. CEO coach Steve Tappin, who works with many top chief executives around the world, says it's important for them to invest time and effort in improving their public speaking skills. \"Wise CEOs know that good training can not only help them to become not only more confident speakers but more authentic ones too, and that counts for a lot in an age in which building trust has never been more important,\" he says. Jeannette Nelson, head of voice at the National Theatre, suggests the following: Andrew Penn, who became chief executive of Australian telecommunications giant Telstra last May, has done exactly that. As a high school drop out who didn't go to university, Mr Penn got to the top by studying outside of his day job. He says he's continued to place a big emphasis on his personal development, including communication skills. In the first 12 years of his working life, he spent every evening and weekend studying; working his way through his high school qualifications, then onto a business diploma, training as an accountant and eventually doing an MBA. \"Communication is probably the most important skill of the chief executive in the modern world\", he says. He believes all bosses should spend time improving  these skills. \"One of the things you're trying to achieve as the CEO is to achieve alignment around lots of different stakeholders, alignment with the team in terms of what the vision is and what you're trying to achieve, alignment with the shareholders and stakeholders so you can take them along on the journey.\" \"So if you can't communicate effectively as a CEO in very simple terms - your vision, your strategy, what you're trying to achieve - then it's very difficult to get that alignment,\" he says. However, Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson, who regularly speaks in front of big audiences, warns that it's important not to become too polished. \"People want real people, they don't want smooth talkers who've been very well trained in public speaking,\" he says. If his children ever have to do a speech, he tells them to \"just be yourself\" and talk in exactly the same way to the audience as if they were sitting in a living room having a chat with a friend. Ultimately, Ms Nelson says being comfortable with public speaking is about being comfortable with yourself, which she says will show when you stand up on stage, making it easier to order  your thoughts and to come across genuinely. But in the end it's the old adage: practice makes perfect. \"People want the magic wand. 'I'll do that and everything will change',\" says Ms Nelson.

{"text":"The evolutionary strategy used by cicadas of the genus Magicicada make use of prime numbers. These insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most.\n\nBy analyzing the positions of the twigs on the body of a Magicicada larva, biologists discovered that it makes no use of the prime numbers for calculating the correct position of the head and body, or for guiding food intake into their mouth. When a caterpillar digs it burrow, the end of the burrow is always a single twig, allowing for the use of prime numbers to calculate the appropriate point of entry into the burrow.\n\nThe most likely reason for the lack of prime numbers in the cicada brain is that the larvae have no control over the timing of their burrowing. A caterpillar that burrowed right before a particular twig is fully developed would be eating it right after that twig, because the twig is a waste product. Similarly, a caterpillar that burrowed next to the next twig would need to eat before it emerged, and since it doesn't feed before pupating, it'll get eaten when it emerges.\n\nWhen the caterpillar emerges, though, one, two, or three of its eggs will be still clinging to the twig, and the larvae will use them for food. The problem is that the caterpillar will still have twigs wrapped up on its body, so it'll be unable to take the first, second, or second-to-last twig. This will cause the larvae to leave their burrows, thus allowing the burrow to empty of food before the caterpillar emerges.\n\nThis","prompt_len":309.0,"label":"gpt2","text_length":1638}

{"text":"Rather like Paul Newman and Steve McQueen with their racing car movies this has all the appearance of a \"\"jollies\"\" project for Robert Redford, as he gets to ski up hill and down dale in the Alpine sunshine.<br \/><br \/>The story is as light as powdered snow with Redford's small-town boy David Chappellet (what kind of lead name is that?) who with his eyes on the prize of Olympic glory, gets up the nose of, in no particular order, his coach, father and team-mates. Women are a mere side-show in his insular world as evidenced by a fairly distasteful pick-up scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of, heavens above, a free-thinking, independent woman, played by Camilla Sparv. The ski-ing sequences are fine with some good stunt-work involving numerous bumps and scrapes on the piste but their effectiveness is dimmed by our subsequent familiarity with top TV coverage of skiing events down to the present day. Plus I'm not convinced that the Winter Olympics has the same mass identification with the general public as the summer games so that when Redford eventually wins his gold medal in the final reel, I couldn't really be that excited for him one way or another.<br \/><br \/>Of the actors, Redford, best profile forward, doesn't need to do much and indeed doesn't, while Gene Hackman does better with equally meagre material. Ms Sparv does well as the chief female interest well who treats Redford the way he's doubtless treated every other woman in his chauvinistic way.<br \/><br \/>In truth though, there's a lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequences don't fully compensate and you don't care a fig for any of the leading characters.

{"text":"PREY <br \/><br \/>Aspect ratio: 1.37:1<br \/><br \/>Sound format: Mono<br \/><br \/>A lesbian couple (Sally Faulkner and Glory Annan) living in a remote country house are driven apart by the arrival of a young man (Barry Stokes) who turns out to be a flesh-eating alien, the vanguard of a massive invasion...<br \/><br \/>Despite its shoestring budget and leaden pacing, Norman J. Warren's follow-up to SATAN'S SLAVE (1976) amounts to a great deal more than the sum of its meager parts, thanks to a surprisingly complex script by Max Cuff (apparently, his only writing credit): Faulkner and Annan indulge an obsessive relationship whilst living in isolated splendor within the English countryside (rendered alternately beautiful and ominous by Derek V. Browne's eye-catching cinematography), though Annan's discovery of bloodstained clothing in an upstairs room marks one (or both) of these doe-eyed lovelies as psychologically disturbed, which may explain the absence of their respective families, some of whom appear to have lived in the house at one time or another and 'left' under mysterious circumstances. Stokes' unexpected arrival throws the relationship into disarray, partly because Faulkner has a pathological hatred of men and partly because Annan is attracted to him, creating tensions which result in a climactic whirlwind of violence. There's an extraordinary, multi-layered sequence in which Faulkner attempts to 'emasculate' their clueless visitor by dressing him in women's clothing, though Stokes' alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockery.<br \/><br \/>In the early scenes, at least, the relationship between Faulkner and Annan is depicted with uncommon grace and dignity, but this heartfelt sapphic liaison quickly devolves into crowd-pleasing episodes of sex and pulchritude, culminating in an explosion of horror when Annan allows herself to be ravished by Stokes following a violent argument with Faulkner. The closing sequences are (quite literally) gut-wrenching, especially Annan's final scene, which appears to have been clipped for censorship reasons in 1977 and never fully restored (what remains is still pretty vivid, so brace yourselves!). Excellent performances by the three leads, bolstered by Warren's unobtrusive direction, which takes full advantage of the stunning woodland locations, thereby compensating for the film's budgetary shortcomings.

Mr Alexander told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the government was continuing efforts to tackle tax avoidance. He said this work was taking place both in the UK and abroad. \"Taxation for big companies, or for anyone in society, can't be, and mustn't be, a voluntary arrangement,\" said Mr Alexander. \"Thinking of the tax system as if it is like the church plate going around on a Sunday morning is completely the wrong way to think about it.\" He added: \"Paying tax is not a voluntary choice, it is not something you can just chose to do willy nilly because you think it will please your customers, it is an obligation.\" Coffee chain Starbucks announced on Thursday of last week that it would pay about \u00a320m in UK corporation tax [tax on its profits] over the next two years, following a public outcry over how little it pays. The company has paid just \u00a38.6m in corporation tax in its 14 years of trading in the UK, and nothing in the last three years, despite UK sales of nearly \u00a3400m in 2011. Two other multinational companies which have also been criticised for paying too little corporation tax - Amazon and Google - both said they would not be following Starbucks' voluntary contribution lead. London Mayor Boris Johnson on Sunday defended companies, such as Starbucks, for seeking to minimise the level of tax they paid in the UK. In an interview on Sky News, he said: \"Imagine that you are the corporate finance director of one of these companies. \"Your job is to look at the law as it stands. Your fiduciary duty to your shareholders is to minimise your tax exposure.\" Mr Johnson added that Starbucks should be praised for announcing that going forward it would voluntarily pay UK corporation tax. \"Now that Starbucks has stepped up to the plate and announced they are going to be making this payment I think rather than everybody sneering at them, people should welcome that,\" he said. \"My point is it is a bit unfair to bash the companies and then sneer at them when they try to do good.\" Mr Alexander also reiterated that the government had announced in last week's Autumn Statement that it was giving HM Revenue & Customs more funds to tackle tax avoidance and evasion. He said the aim was to get an additional \u00a39bn in tax revenues per year. Mr Alexander added that the government, together with Germany and France, was putting additional funds into the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, to aid work on establishing global agreements to prevent companies avoiding tax by moving profits from one country to another with a lower tax rate. \"At a time of austerity, everyone has an obligation to to play by the tax rules,\" he added.

Furthermore, the diffeomorphism algebra can be viewed as a symmetry of scattering amplitudes, and can be used to derive nontrivial relations between amplitudes that are not obvious from the Feynman diagrams. This provides a powerful new tool for computing scattering amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory, and opens up new avenues for studying the properties of the theory.\n\nMoreover, we show that the kinematic numerators of tree-level MHV amplitudes can be related to the momentum twistors associated with the external particles. This leads to a reformulation of the scattering amplitudes in terms of these twistors, which provides a geometric interpretation of the amplitudes and allows for a more efficient computation of higher-loop amplitudes. In particular, we demonstrate that the tree-level MHV amplitudes can be expressed in terms of the Parke-Taylor formula, which provides a simple and elegant expression for the amplitudes in terms of the external momenta.\n\nOverall, our results provide a deep insight into the structure of scattering amplitudes in Yang-Mills theory and underscore the importance of the diffeomorphism algebra and its relationship to the colour algebra.

This approach allows us to compare the predictions of different theories and their ability to account for the experimental results. It also avoids the pitfalls of interpreting weak values as measurements of pre- and post-selected states or as manifestations of nonlocality or contextuality. Instead, we focus on the observable consequences of post-selection and the statistical properties of the weak value measurements. By defining anomalous averages in an operational way, we can probe the quantum properties of weak values and devise tests that discriminate between quantum and classical theories. In this sense, the question of what is genuinely quantum about weak values becomes a fruitful one, not because it leads to a definitive answer, but because it stimulates the development of new operational tools for testing quantum foundations and exploring the limits of classicality.","prompt_len":429.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1315}

It was the first in a trilogy (unfinished, of course) about three friends who find an evil monster lurking in the sewers beneath their church. There were shadowy characters, adventures into the unknown, heroism, and monsters. Now, while my book went into a much more spiritual-warfare, mythology realm with demons and angels and minotaurs and labyrinths, the heart of the story was the adventure.I had been influenced by reading the Harry Potter books and they were just so incredibly fun to read. The characters were likable (for the most part) and the sense of adventure was truly fantastic. Everything I love about storytelling was summed up there, and I did my best to translate that into a novel. Adventure.Adamsville is that sense of adventure that I wanted to see and read and write. When Michael gave me the advanced copy to read, I must say that I devoured it. I realize this is cliche, but I really had a hard time putting the thing down. I didn't want to stop reading. The characters are believable and likable. The humor is spot-on and keeps the whole thing from becoming too dark for the kiddos. And man, oh, man.

He knew what the power of ideas could do and went after his visions of those things with such a sense of purpose and belief in himself, and humanity really. It's something I think that is missing today in the arts unfortunately. There is such a breed of cynicism right now in creative things. I have a hard time really getting behind so much of where the industry is going because mostly it doesn't inspire me to anything. Walt's vision was built around the best things of people and it uplifted everyone around him. I'm also amazed at how many times in Walt's early life he was met with failure and when most of us would have turned and chose an easier path\u2026 He just picked up and kept going. Mickey Mouse was a character he created after his character Oswald the Rabbit was stolen from him, in a moment that would have jaded most people. The rest is history.

FD often affects the long bones and craniofacial bones, leading to pain, deformities, and fractures. Diagnosis of FD requires imaging studies such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI. Biopsy may be necessary in some cases to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment options include observation, surgery, and medication. Surgical intervention may be necessary for severe cases that cause deformities or fractures. Medications such as bisphosphonates may be used to decrease bone turnover and improve bone density. Follow-up monitoring is essential to monitor disease progression and detect any potential complications.

{"text":"Both X.25 and Frame Relay provide connection-oriented operations. But X.25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X.25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user-network-interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X.25 does specify some limited re-transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC-type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN's layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end-to-end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X.25 UNI protocol is part of the X.25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X.25 within the network as well, but its connection-oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node-to-node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X.25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X.25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X.25 its packet IDs---the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection-oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC\/LAPD\/LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM). X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection-oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X.25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS. <Uyless Black, X.25 and Related Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991> <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Networks, McGraw-Hill, 1998> <Uyless Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> < Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 1995>","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":3145}

The results of the study showed that the use of clopidogrelaspirin was cost-effective compared to using aspirin alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $3,866 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. This means that for every $3,866 spent on the clopidogrelaspirin regimen, one additional QALY was gained, which is considered cost-effective in the healthcare industry.\n\nSensitive analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the results and it was found that the model was sensitive to the cost of clopidogrelaspirin, but the results were still within an acceptable range.\n\nIn conclusion, the results suggest that the use of clopidogrelaspirin for acute TIA or minor stroke is cost-effective compared to aspirin alone.

{"text":"Teaching maths and science to all up to 18 would \"produce a wiser population\", says new British Science Association president Dame Athene Donald. Prof Donald will use her address to next week's British Science Festival to urge major changes to UK education. In particular, pupils are asked to specialise too young, she will argue. \"Citizens need to be empowered to make good decisions in their private lives - be it about vaccinations, mobile phone masts or climate change,\" she will tell the festival, at Bradford University. In order for this to happen, she will say, more young people need to be interested in and comfortable with science. She believes the problem starts young, with too few teachers able to teach primary school science or trained as subject specialists at secondary level. Forcing pupils to make subject choices from the age of 14, effectively divides the nation \"into sheep and goats, science people and arts people\", she will argue. \"Too often we find ourselves apparently in opposing camps - and our culture these days always makes it seem as if the scientists are the outsiders. \"We may be mocked if our knowledge of Shakespeare or Austen isn't perfect, but it is still OK to say 'I could never do maths at school.'\" Echoing calls for a shift to a Baccalaureate-type exam to give a broader, less specialist education for post-16s than is currently available, Prof Donald will say that \"in most other countries, children are simply not allowed not to study maths right up until they leave school\". She will also hit out at gender stereotyping which she says has seen too few women in science. \"We need to change mindsets of teachers and parents alike,\" she will say, \"to ensure that both genders get equal airtime in the classroom, that boys don't hog the apparatus.\" \"Because science is so integral in our everyday lives, having an attitude that it's all nasty, scary and dangerous stuff is enormously unhelpful if not positively dangerous. \"We should be working hard to ensure parents are not bamboozled by basic facts.\" A spokesman for England's Department for Education agreed maths and science were \"vital\" in everyday life, \"whether you are running your own business of trying to pick the best mortgage\". Thousands more students are now leaving education with good GCSEs in science and maths subjects, said the spokesman, while the number of A-level entries in these subjects has risen by more than 38,000 since 2010. \"The new, robust, national curriculum introduced last year includes extra emphasis on maths at primary school and will be introducing new science GCSEs next year,\" he added.

The universities accused the trust of making \"unjustified criticisms\" and perpetuating \"common myths\". The report comes after David Cameron warned top institutions they needed to do more to tackle social inequality. The Sutton Trust says would-be undergraduates at Oxford and Cambridge have to undergo different interviews, tests and written assessments depending on the course and college to which they are applying. \"Both universities evaluate many different aspects of a prospective student's application in great detail,\" the report, Oxbridge Admissions, says. \"But this means that there is significant complexity in the admissions system to both universities, which can seem off-putting to students unfamiliar with the process who may have little support from their schools.\" It also warns that interviews \"can be intimidating for young people, not least to those who have not had significant preparation and support to prepare\". The Sutton Trust report highlights a number of issues it says make the current admissions procedure complicated. For example: The Sutton Trust report comes just days after Cambridge University announced would-be undergraduates would have to sit written tests as part of the application process. The university said the aim was to maintain fairness during changes to the qualification system in England. Responding to the report, a spokesman for Cambridge University said the university had worked closely with the Sutton Trust to widen participation. \"We are therefore disappointed that this report demonstrates a lack of understanding of our admissions process and makes a series of incorrect and unjustified criticisms and recommendations,\" he said. \"We have a proven track record of improving access. We are committed to widening participation whilst maintaining high academic standards. \"We continually review our admissions processes and the effectiveness of our extensive widening participation work.\" A spokeswoman for Oxford University said: \"We are disappointed that one of our longstanding access partners is actively perpetuating some of the most common myths about how the selection process works. \"These myths are a fundamental barrier to Oxford's access work, and only reinforce perceptions that deter exactly those candidates we try hardest to encourage to apply.\" She said Oxford was committed to transparency and self-scrutiny and reviewed its selection criteria and admissions policies on an \"ongoing basis\". \"Oxford is interested not just in demonstrated ability but academic potential, and admissions tutors carefully consider not just candidates' achievements but the context in which they occur when making offers,\" she said. Sir Peter Lampl, who chairs the Sutton Trust, said: \"Our surveys and experience suggest that many bright state school students are put off by the application process, which is both intimidating and complex. \"Specifically, we believe that the universities rather than the colleges should control the admissions policies and interviews. \"The numbers of additional exams and tests should be reviewed, again to avoid advantaging those who gain from extra tuition and support. \"More should be done to consider contextual admissions, recognising how much harder it can be for a bright student in a tough inner city school than in a successful private or state school.\" ","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":3464}

It was, he said, the \"most important task\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 in the present stage of building a thriving socialist economy\". Pyongyang has become increasingly isolated internationally over the past few years, and has become heavily reliant on China for its economic survival. With a new president due to take office in South Korea next month, some analysts saw signs of conciliation.  President-elect Park Geun-hye has said she wants to rebuild trust, and - eventually - economic and diplomatic contacts with the North. In the new year speech, her counterpart in Pyongyang called for an end to confrontation between the North and the South, and for both sides to \"respect... and implement\" previously-agreed declarations. Many in the South - and in Washington - will want to see concrete evidence of Pyongyang's willingness to do that. But while he said confrontation between the North and the South should be removed, Mr Kim stressed that military power remained a national priority. \"The military might of a country represents its national strength. Only when it builds up its military might in every way can it develop into a thriving country,\" he said. The message coincides with UN Security Council discussions on how to punish Pyongyang for a recent long-range rocket launch. Under Mr Kim's leadership, North Korea has conducted two long-range rocket launches - actions condemned by the US and Pyongyang's neighbours as banned tests of missile technology. The launch in April failed, but December's attempt appears to have been a success, placing a satellite into orbit. The US, Japan and South Korea are seeking a response in the UN Security Council, which banned North Korea from missile tests after nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009.

In 543, while a monk, Benedict saw a vision, saying that a plague could be stopped. He wrote down that prayer, which in English would be as follows: \"St. Michael, defend us in battle.

{"text":"Paleoclimatologists measure the ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to determine what the climate was like millions of years ago (see oxygen isotope ratio cycle). Seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope, oxygen-16, evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12% heavier oxygen-18; this disparity increases at lower temperatures. During periods of lower global temperatures, snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen-16, and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen-18. This means that marine organisms that lived during colder periods incorporated more oxygen-18 into their shells and skeletons than organisms that lived during warmer periods. By analyzing the ratio of oxygen isotopes in these fossilized organisms, paleoclimatologists can determine when the climate was colder and when it was warmer, providing a timeline of climate change over millions of years. This technique has been used to reconstruct the climate of Earth's distant past, including during ice ages and warm periods such as the Eocene and the Miocene. The information gathered from these studies provides crucial insights into how the Earth's climate has varied over time and can help us better understand and predict the effects of current and future climate changes.","prompt_len":595.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1369}

The McCord family ethos was not just a superficial idea but was deeply ingrained in the hospital's organizational structure, including decision-making processes and employee relations. The hospital's leadership actively sought to create a sense of community among its staff, encouraging collaboration, mutual support, and a commitment to the hospital's mission. This sense of shared purpose was evident in the high level of staff retention and the dedication of employees who often worked long hours beyond their shifts to ensure that patients received the care they needed.\n\nThe family culture at McCord also extended beyond the hospital's walls. The hospital was deeply connected to the surrounding community, often collaborating with other organizations and community members to address the healthcare needs of local residents. Patients were often seen as members of the McCord family, and the hospital's staff sought to create a welcoming and supportive environment for all who entered its doors.\n\nBut the McCord family ethos was not without its challenges. As a mission hospital, the hospital was often under-resourced and struggled to keep up with the demands of a growing population. The hospital also operated in a deeply unequal society, with racial and gender disparities that were reflected in the hospital's workforce and patient population. Despite these challenges, the McCord family persisted, committed to providing quality healthcare to all who sought its services.\n\nIn conclusion, the McCord family ethos played a vital role in shaping the identity and longevity of the McCord Hospital in Durban. While the idea of a hospital family may be contentious, the commitment to faith and service, as well as a sense of communal purpose, helped to create a unique and resilient organizational culture that has endured for over a century.","prompt_len":839.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":2687}

{"text":"objectiveto describe and test a practical protocol to measure common carotid intima - media thickness that uses the combined values of two longitudinal examination angles to increase sensitivity.methodbetween february and september 2005 , 206 patients underwent duplex scan examination of carotid vessels , and the intima - media thickness of 407 common carotids were measured in three angles : transversal , longitudinal posterolateral , and anterolateral , with three intima - media thickness measurements for each near and far wall . in addition to numbers obtained from the three angles of measurement , a fourth visual perspective was obtained by combining the intima - media thickness results of posterolateral and anterolateral longitudinal views and considering the thickest wall measurement.resultstwo hundred seventy ( 66.3% ) carotid arteries had an intima - media thickness thicker than 1 mm . the mean intima - media thickness values achieved by the different incidences were 1.260.6 mm ( transversal ) , 1.170.54 mm ( longitudinal anterolateral ) , and 1.180.58 mm ( longitudinal posterolateral ) . The results showed that the combined values of the intima-media thickness measurements in the posterolateral and anterolateral angles were significantly higher than the values obtained from the transversal and longitudinal measurements. The mean intima-media thickness obtained from the combined measurements was 1.320.62 mm, which was significantly higher than the values obtained from the other angles.\n\nFurthermore, the combined measurements showed a higher sensitivity (85.7%) compared to the individual measurements, which had sensitivity values of 73.6% for transversal, 76.3% for longitudinal posterolateral, and 76.2% for longitudinal anterolateral measurements. The high sensitivity of the combined measurements suggests that this approach could be a more effective way of detecting changes in the carotid artery than the individual measurements.\n\nIn conclusion, this study provides evidence to support the use of a combined approach to measure common carotid intima-media thickness, using the values obtained from the posterolateral and anterolateral longitudinal angles. This protocol could be useful in detecting changes in the carotid artery early on, enabling healthcare providers to implement preventive measures to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.","prompt_len":1112.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":2386}

{"text":"Pressure on George Osborne to raise personal tax allowances further and faster in the forthcoming budget as a way of stimulating the economy grew on Sunday when the Liberal Democrats David Laws and Simon Hughes, and the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, all backed the proposal.The Lib Dems have decided to mount a public campaign to urge their coalition partners to raise the personal allowance further, a tax cut long favoured by the party but also seen as a way of stimulating demand at a time of low growth.It is significant that Hughes, the Lib Dem deputy leader and a leading figurehead of the party's left, is backing the campaign alongside Laws, the party's leading economic liberal.Laws quit as Treasury chief secretary soon after the government was formed, but has continued with a discreet backroom role, aiding Nick Clegg across Whitehall. He will spell out why he believes the personal allowance should be raised in a broadcast interview on Monday night and in newspaper articles. A Lib Dem party election broadcast will also be devoted to the subject on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Balls has asserted that tax cuts are now the best short-term route to stimulating demand in the economy, moving away from his previous emphasis on extra Whitehall spending, a position that wins little support among those worried by the existing deficit.Even unfunded tax cuts win more support from voters than extra government spending, though the impact on borrowing is the same.Balls insisted his preference was still for tax cuts built round a temporary cut in VAT costing \u00a312bn, and acknowledged that the tax cut would raise borrowing.Writing in the Sunday Times, Balls argued that while some people may be surprised to see Labour prioritising tax cuts, in a crisis there was \"a premium on what works effectively and quickly\" to get the economy moving.\"But if George Osborne can't bring himself to reverse his VAT mistake, he has other options,\" said Balls. \"For the same amount of money, he could cut the basic rate of income tax by 3p for a year. Or raise the income tax personal allowance to over \u00a310,000. Or increase tax credits for almost six million working people by around \u00a32,000.\"It would be better to cut VAT now \u2013 it's fairer and quicker and would help pensioners and others who don't pay income tax. But any substantial tax cuts to help households and stimulate the economy would be better than doing nothing.\"Clegg has not specified how much more quickly he would like to see the personal tax allowance raised or how he would fund it, apart from insisting that it would have to be funded and not merely paid for through extra borrowing.In a speech to the Resolution Foundation in January, he did however promise that any increase in personal allowance would not be funded through cuts to tax credits or other spending cuts, and said the wealthy would have to bear the burden.Gavin Kelly, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, underlined the significance of the Lib Dem move: \"Up until now each rise in the personal allowance ... has","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":3040}

What is group field theory?\n\nGroup field theory is a relatively new formalism in the field of quantum gravity that aims to describe the quantum properties of space-time using a mathematical structure called a group field.\n\nWhat is a group field?\n\nA group field is a mathematical object that generalizes the concept of a group, which is a set of elements with a binary operation that satisfies certain properties. In group field theory, a group field encodes not just the properties of a group, but also the geometry of space-time.\n\nHow does group field theory relate to loop quantum gravity?\n\nGroup field theory is a natural extension of loop quantum gravity, another approach to quantum gravity that also uses the language of group theory. In fact, loop quantum gravity can be seen as a special case of group field theory, where the group field is defined on a discrete lattice.\n\nWhat are the advantages of using group field theory?\n\nOne advantage of group field theory is that it provides a natural framework for including matter fields, such as particles, into the quantum description of space-time. It also allows for a unified treatment of different approaches to quantum gravity, such as loop quantum gravity and string theory.\n\nWhat are the challenges of using group field theory?\n\nOne challenge of group field theory is that it is a very abstract and mathematical formalism, which can make it difficult to connect with physical observations. There are also technical difficulties involved in solving the equations of the theory and finding physically meaningful solutions.\n\nWhat are some possible future directions for group field theory?\n\nOne possibility is that group field theory could provide a new way of unifying quantum mechanics and gravity, which is one of the biggest unsolved problems in physics. It could also lead to new insights into the nature of space-time and the fundamental structure of the universe. However, much more research is needed in order to fully develop and understand the potential of this approach.","prompt_len":317.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":2356}

Analysis of a silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space and returned by the crashed Genesis spacecraft has shown that the Sun has a higher proportion of oxygen-16 than does the Earth. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the formation and evolution of the solar system. It suggests that the oxygen isotopic compositions of the inner planets (Earth, Mars) and meteorites may have been influenced by processes such as planetesimal accretion, differentiation, and\/or late-stage impacts that led to chemical homogenization. Furthermore, the higher abundance of oxygen-16 in the Sun may have implications for the nuclear reactions that power the Sun, as the fusion of oxygen-16 with hydrogen is a key step in the proton-proton chain that produces energy in the Sun's core. Overall, the measurement of oxygen isotopes in the Sun provides new insights into the chemical and physical processes that shaped the early solar system and continue to influence the behavior of our nearest star.","prompt_len":472.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1299}

A Parole Board panel recommended her release from prison following a second review of her case. The board said arrangements and the date of the release were a matter for Justice Secretary Chris Grayling. A spokesman for Mr Grayling said the Parole Board's decision was final. A statement from the board said: \"We can confirm that a three-member panel of the board has directed the release of Tracey Connelly. \"Tracey Connelly first became eligible for parole in August 2012 and at that time a Parole Board panel made no recommendation to release.\" Peter died on 3 August 2007 at home in Haringey after months of abuse. He had more than 50 injuries, despite being on the at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals over eight months. Connelly was jailed with her boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen, who were convicted at trial of the same offence. Barker was jailed for life with a minimum of 10 years for raping a two-year-old girl and given a 12-year term to run concurrently for his \"major role\" in Peter's death. Owen was jailed indefinitely with a minimum three-year term but later won an appeal to lower it to a fixed six-year term. He was freed in August 2011 but was then recalled to prison in April this year. When making its decision, the Parole Board will take into account the nature of the offence, the prisoner's offending history, the prisoner's progress in prison and any statements made on behalf of the victim. Reports from psychologists, probation officers and prison officers are also taken into account. Connelly will remain on licence for the rest of her life and if she breaches any of the conditions, she would most likely be recalled to custody. Conditions can include curfews, restrictions on movements and frequent meetings with an offender manager, said a Ministry of Justice spokesman. ","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":2026}
{"text":"The Normans had a profound effect on Irish culture and history after their invasion at Bannow Bay in 1169. Initially the Normans maintained a distinct culture and ethnicity. Yet, with time, they came to be subsumed into Irish culture to the point that it has been said that they became \"more Irish than the Irish themselves.\" The Normans settled mostly in an area in the east of Ireland, later known as the Pale, and also built many fine castles and settlements, including Trim Castle and Dublin Castle. Both cultures intermixed, borrowing from each other's language, culture and outlook. Norman descendants today can be recognised by their surnames. Names such as French, (De) Roche, Devereux, D'Arcy, Treacy and Lacy are particularly common in the southeast of Ireland, especially in the southern part of County Wexford where the first Norman settlements were established. Other Norman names such as Furlong predominate there. Another common Norman-Irish name was Morell (Murrell) derived from the French Norman name Morel. Other names beginning with Fitz (from the Norman for son) indicate Norman ancestry. These included Fitzgerald, FitzGibbons (Gibbons) dynasty, Fitzmaurice.

{"text":"Diplomatic ties have been broken, angry words exchanged and Iranian protesters stormed the Saudi embassy in Tehran. But the dispute between the two Middle Eastern nations has deep religious, historic and political roots. Iran and Saudi Arabia are on opposing sides of a more than 1,000-year old argument at the heart of Islam - between Sunnis and Shia. After the death of the Prophet Muhammad, his followers split over who was his rightful heir. It is important not to overstate the division. Sunnis and Shia share fundamental beliefs, and have co-existed for centuries - the animosity between Iran and Saudi Arabia is better understood in terms of a power struggle in the Middle East and beyond. But despite this, sectarianism is an ugly reality in many of the conflicts raging today. Iran and Saudi Arabia's status as leading exponents of Shia and Sunni Islam respectively have informed their foreign policies, with both sides forming alliances with countries who share their theologies - and backing militant groups in those that don't. Islam's ancient schism The recent rift between Iran and Saudi Arabia can be traced to the Iranian revolution of 1979, which saw a pro-Western leader toppled and Shia religious authorities taking over. Tehran began backing Shia militias and parties abroad, and Riyadh - concerned at the growing influence of a newly-strident Iran - strengthened links to other Sunni governments, including the formation of the Gulf Co-operation Council. The 1980s saw tensions between Saudi and Iran escalate - Saudi Arabia backed Iraq's Saddam Hussein, and after clashes at the hajj in 1987 killed hundreds of Iranian pilgrims, Saudi Arabia suspended diplomatic ties for three years. Another key milestone was the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq, when the overthrow of Saddam Hussein saw a Shia-led government come to power in Riyadh's neighbour. The Arab Spring saw Iran support its ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, with the Saudis backing the opposition when popular protests turned into civil war. In Bahrain, Saudi troops helped put down anti-government protests by the majority Shia population there. Saudi Arabia felt threatened by last year's Iranian nuclear deal, fearing the easing of sanctions would allow Tehran to further support Shia groups in the Middle East. If you add to this the Iranian fury over a deadly stampede during last year's Hajj pilgrimage and a more assertive Saudi foreign policy since the new king took charge, then the row over the execution of Sheikh Nimr becomes just the latest in a long-running struggle. Iran-Saudi crisis 'most dangerous for decades' Today there are two ongoing major flashpoints - Syria and Yemen. As news emerged of the executions, a Saudi-led coalition battling Shia Houthi rebels in Yemen officially announced the end of a ceasefire that neither side had ever fully observed. Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of backing the Shia group, and intervened to support Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. Divisions on Syria boil down to the fact that Iran wants its ally, President Assad, to stay while Saudi Arabia says he must go. Both support rival fighters on the ground. Painstaking efforts were taken to get the two sides to join peace talks later this month aimed at resolving a conflict that has killed more than 250,000 people, but with Riyadh-Tehran diplomatic ties severed, chances of success look ever more distant. Where key countries stand on Syria Perhaps the only thing we can be certain about is that hostile Iranian-Saudi relations will only prolong the misery of Yemen and Syria, with a diplomatic solution unlikely and both sides keen to prevent the other gaining influence. International reaction has been predictable, with Saudi allies such as Bahrain also taking measures to downgrade or end relations with Iran. World powers have called for de-escalation. The US is in a delicate position, being a long-term ally of Saudi Arabia but seeing a thaw in ties with Iran in the wake of the nuclear deal. American foreign policy is undergoing a \"pivot\" towards Asia; the US enjoys greater energy security following a fracking boom - how far would Washington be prepared to wade into the row? The gloomiest prediction from commentators is that the region could be entering a version of the Thirty Years' War, which saw Catholic and Protestant states battle for supremacy in the 17th Century. But many will be hoping those angered by Sheikh Nimr's death will take the advice of the cleric's own brother, Mohammed, who said any protests should be peaceful.

{"text":"The tourist season has just ended on a remote island off the coast of Scotland, winter is beginning to set in and the inhabitants, both humans and sheep alike are settling down to much quieter times ahead. Michael Gaffikin (James Warwick) a former paratrooper in the British Army, is the local dentist, he's not an islander by birth and as such his relationship with local artist and cartographer Fiona Patterson (Celia Imrie) is always being viewed with a little suspicion, not maliciously, but just out of the protective instincts the tight knit community have for their kin. The islands serenity is broken when Gaffikin out for a solitary round of golf finds the headless remains of a brutally slain woman. He immediately reports his gruesome find to Insp Inskip(Maurice Ro\u00ebves) at the islands police station, Inskip arranges for delivery of the remains to local GP, Dr Goudry, for closer inspection. A quick search for the killer proves fruitless, as does a search for a missing local woman. Over dinner that night with Michael Gaffikin, Fiona realises that the dead woman might be Sheila Anderson, a woman from the mainland, who lives on the island through the winter months. A quick search at her home Dove Cottage reveals the missing remains of her body, her home proving to be the murder scene, but why did the killer drag her torso over a mile into the woods? Suspicion immediately falls on the one stranger left on the island, one Colonel Howard (Jonathan Newth)who also happened be the last person to see her alive as they came across on the last ferry together.<br \/><br \/>Goudry asks Gaffikin for some dental expertise on the victims body, it reveals that she had been torn apart my somebody or something with great strength, one set of teeth marks on the body seem to point at a human killer, another points to that of an unknown animal of some kind. A sheep is found mutilated and then a Canadian ornithologist is found slain. With a heavy fog rolling in, the island is cut off from the mainland and any possibility of help, the radio also doesn't work, seemingly being blocked and the phone lines have been cut. Reports of UFO's and the sighting of a camouflaged soldier are compounded by the finding of an odd looking craft hidden behind rocks on the beach. Inskip is confused and refuses to listen to anything but the facts and laughs off Gaffikin's idea that aliens might be involved, but a rise in radioactive levels on the island, has him doubting himself.<br \/><br \/>The Nightmare Man is based on the novel, Child of the Vodyanoi by David Wiltshire, it is here adapted by Dr Who and Blake's 7 scriptwriter Robert Holmes and directed by Douglas Camfield who also had directing experience on both Sci\/Fi classics and the film benefits from having such experienced genre experts on board. The Nightmare Man though is on the whole, a succinctly better crafted piece, that builds its plot alongside solid character development, even down to the minor characters, time is given to giving them all a firm background. The island setting is perhaps a genre clich\u00e9 that has been used over and over, but its one that I enjoy very much, the remoteness, the sense of being under siege with no way out always add to the atmosphere and here it is given an extra oomph by having an impenetrable fog close in to hamper all efforts. In many genre efforts of this kind it is very easy for proceedings to get silly and for the plot to resort to melodrama, but credit to Camfield, he holds it all together with the emphasis being on believability at all times. There is an authenticity about proceedings, the characters even speaking Gaelic at times to further this point. If there is one negative about the killer its that, we are given his\/her\/its POV for the killings, an acceptable clich\u00e9 on its own, but when seen through a red filter and a fish eye lens, it just screams of overkill and dates the film just a little. Still though you will be hard pressed to guess the outcome or the identity or for that matter the species of the killer, given the clues presented, but it's a fun and very well acted piece. The local Scottish cast are exceptional, the local bobbies Roeves and Cosmo in particular spar well off each other and are a delight to behold. Imrie, never one i've taken to in other works, is also pretty good and displays hew womanly physique as if she were in a Hammer production. The outlandish, maybe even preposterous ending may irk some viewers, it disappointed me in some ways, but taking into account when it was made, its an understandable and acceptable addendum that if you think about it, is even more terrifying.\"","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":4641}

This contradiction is never that much of an issue, because Simon Pegg (as Sidney) projects likability too well.<br \/><br \/>Jeff Bridges underplays Sidney's editor a little too effectively, and Kirsten Dunst is rather anonymous as the conflicted eventual object of Sidney's affections And, with regard to Megan Fox (who plays an airhead bimbo starlet), I can say only this: just say the word, Miss Fox, and I will leave my wife, sell all my belongings, and buy myself a plane ticket in order to take my place at your side as your consort.

{"text":"Abstract : Dairy foods contain complex nutrients which interact with the host. Yet, evolution of lactase persistence has divided the human species into those that can or cannot digest lactose in adulthood. Such a ubiquitous trait has differential effects on humanity. The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of different lactose tolerances on the evolution of the lactase persistence phenotype. The findings suggest that lactose tolerance is not merely a byproduct of lactose digestion, as originally assumed, but instead is an evolutionary determinant of the physiological response to lactose. The association between lactose tolerance and disease has led to speculation regarding adaptive constraints on lactose tolerance. We hypothesize that lactose-tolerant humans are less susceptible to obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cancer.\n\nKeywords \u2022 Diet and evolution \u2022 Diet and medicine\n\nThere are two basic levels of lactose digestion in humans: an early form characterized by facultative lactase persistence (10, 11), and a later form characterized by the presence of lactase persistence (32). Lactase-persistent individuals are the minority of human adults. In most African, American, and Asian populations, lactose digestion is rare, if not extinct. The most common phenotype seen in lactose-tolerant individuals is the absence of lactose-digesting activity, which ranges from 0.3 to 3.7 units\/g lactose (12, 13, 34). These are people with a phenotype of no lactose digestion. Most children and lactose-intolerant adults have some lactose absorption; however, in many adults the enzyme lactase persistence ceases to function in the mature gut after birth (35).\n\nLactose-tolerant individuals of modern societies show health advantages.

Resistive training involves breathing against a resistance, such as using a handheld device that requires higher inhalation force. Pressure threshold loading involves breathing through a device that provides resistance only when a certain threshold of inhalation force is reached. Normocapnic hyperpnea involves controlled breathing at a specific pace and depth to encourage the use of the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that RMT can improve respiratory muscle function, exercise capacity, and quality of life in COPD patients.

We expect the escape of cr nuclei from a supernova remnant to be dominated by an ion-ion interaction, which allows a large energy transfer from the relativistic energy to the thermal energies. The electron-cloud provides the energy source for the decay of cr nuclei. In our simulations, we consider the ion-ion interaction with respect to the thermal energies, which corresponds to the escape of cr nuclei from a quark-gluon plasma formed from the degenerate tau neutrino scattering.","prompt_len":608.0,"label":"gpt2","text_length":1986}

The article cites a few reasons for why they believe this is the case: retailers having to carry too much stock, replacing amiibo with new lines (or waves), and the perspective from consumers that the newest amiibo will be gone. What this has done is lured in resellers trying to make a quick buck by buying up the already limited stock and reselling them on Ebay for an exorbitant mark-up. This has caused frustration for many collectors and gamers, as they are unable to get their hands on their favorite amiibo characters without having to pay a hefty amount. Nintendo has tried to address this issue by increasing production and releasing amiibo restocks, but it seems like the demand is still exceeding supply. The scarcity of certain amiibo has also sparked a sense of urgency among collectors, resulting in long lines and even camping outside stores for the newest releases.

Revolutionary civil disobedience is more of an active attempt to overthrow a government (or to change cultural traditions, social customs, religious beliefs, etc...revolution doesn't have to be political, i.e. \"cultural revolution\", it simply implies sweeping and widespread change to a section of the social fabric). Both types of civil disobedience are rooted in a desire for change, but they differ in their level of intensity and goals. Non-revolutionary civil disobedience aims to bring attention to an issue and either create change through negotiation or peacefully break a law as an act of protest. It is often used by individuals or small groups who do not have the resources or support to engage in a full-fledged revolution. Revolutionary civil disobedience, on the other hand, involves more widespread and aggressive actions with the ultimate goal of overturning a government or other major societal structures. It is typically led by larger groups, organizations, or movements that have a clear vision for the future and are willing to use force or violence if necessary. While non-revolutionary civil disobedience may be more accessible to individuals, revolutionary civil disobedience can be a more effective means of achieving sweeping change in a shorter period of time. However, it also comes with a greater risk of violent conflict and government repression. Ultimately, the choice between non-revolutionary and revolutionary civil disobedience rests on the individual or group's assessment of the situation and their willingness to accept the consequences of their actions.","prompt_len":615.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1891}

But Stephen Eilmann argues that if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality, we might ask why disobedience should take the form of public civil disobedience rather than simply covert lawbreaking. If a lawyer wishes to help a client overcome legal obstacles to securing her or his natural rights, he might, for instance, find that assisting in fabricating evidence or committing perjury is more effective than open disobedience. By contrast, if a civil disobedient has no interest in seeking out or convincing others that the disobedience is right, then it does not seem that a legal means of resistance is called for. Thus, in this way, Stephen Eilmann argues that \"for Stephen by no means limits the range of morally appropriate practices of disobedience and, in any case, the idea that what is morally proper to a particular kind of non-criminal 'disobedience' may need more than a hint of moral justification is clearly false.\"\n\nThe book discusses how many forms of disobedience have been understood in the past.

Laiki Bank - the country's second largest - will be wound up. Finance minister Michael Sarris said Cyprus had avoided a \"disastrous exit from the eurozone\". In a televised address on Monday evening, President Nicos Anastasiades - who negotiated the deal with the \"troika\" of the EU, the European Central Bank and the IMF in Brussels -  said the agreement was \"painful\" but the best option under the circumstances. \"I understand your anger,\" he said. Cyprus's devastating rescue Few winners in Cyprus deal Q&A: Cyprus deal Cyprus banks reassure UK customers To qualify for the bailout, Cyprus has to raise 5.8bn euros. Mr Anastasiades said the agreed measures would be put into practice over the next few days and he called for all Cypriots to work together. He said the central bank would impose some limited \"capital controls\" to prevent an outflow of money when banks reopened. Laiki Bank and the Bank of Cyprus - the country's two biggest - will remain closed until Thursday, but all others will reopen on Tuesday after being closed for more than a week, Cyprus's central bank said. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany - which pushed for terms of the deal - said the cost of the bailout had been fairly distributed. \"We do not want taxpayers to save banks, banks must save themselves,\" she said. \"This is what will happen in the case of Cyprus.\" Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem - who chairs the Eurogroup of finance ministers - said the rescue represented a new template for dealing with bank crises in the eurozone, with uninsured depositors bearing some of the cost. As global markets fell following his remarks, Mr Dijsselbloem issued a clarification, saying Cyprus was a \"specific case with exceptional challenges\". Earlier, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said losses imposed on big depositors - many of them Russian - amounted to \"stealing\". \"What is going on around Cyprus is that they are continuing to plunder loot there,\" Mr Medvedev said. \"It is necessary to understand where this story will lead, and what its consequences will be for the international financial system and our interests,\" he added. Suspicion has been growing in Russia that Europe is using the crisis to target Russian money in Cyprus, the BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow says. By Stephanie FlandersEconomics editor Nonetheless, President Vladimir Putin has told Russian officials to restructure a 2.5bn-euro loan extended to Cyprus in 2011 in order to support the restructuring effort. The European Central Bank had set a deadline of Monday for the deal, which came a week after the Cypriot parliament rejected a proposed bank levy on small and large deposits. The levy would have taken 6.75% from small savers and 9.9% from larger investors and caused widespread anger among ordinary savers. On Friday the new bank restructuring plan was passed by Cypriot MPs. No further vote is needed as there is no levy on deposits under 100,000 euros, which are insured under EU deposit guarantee rules. However, the Memorandum of Understanding between Cyprus and the EU - the formal agreement that triggers eurozone bailouts - will probably require the Cypriot parliament's approval, according to the Open Europe think tank. A \"no\" vote at that stage could still put Cyprus's eurozone membership at risk. Cypriot government spokesman Christos Stylianides said the deal had prevented a \"disorderly\" exit from the euro. \"The important thing is that we have reached an agreement that allows us to kick-start the economy and lay the groundwork for a new beginning,\" he said in a statement. IMF head Christine Lagarde said the bailout deal agreed was \"a comprehensive and credible plan\" to help restore trust in the banking system. There will be relief in Cyprus that small depositors have been protected, but the deal comes at a heavy price, BBC correspondents say. The economy is expected to shrink sharply as offshore banking - Cyprus's main industry - is effectively shut down. The chairman of the Cypriot parliament's finance committee, Nicholas Papadopolous, said the agreement made \"no economic sense\". \"We are heading for a deep recession, high unemployment. They wanted to send a message that the Cypriot economy ought to be destroyed, and they've succeeded in a large part - they've destroyed our banking sector,\" he told the BBC. Under the agreement, Laiki will be split into \"good\" and \"bad\" banks, with its good assets eventually merged into Bank of Cyprus. The percentages to be raised from uninsured deposits of more than 100,000 euros in Laiki bank and in Bank of Cyprus have not yet been announced. Mr Stylianides said the figure could be \"around 30%\" for uninsured Bank of Cyprus deposits. Other estimates have put the figure at about 40%. Correspondents say Germany has pushed hard for a levy on investors who have benefited from high interest rates in recent years, rejecting a Cypriot plan to use money from pension funds.

{"text":"Arguably the finest serial ever made(no argument here thus far) about Earthman Flash Gordon, Professor Zarkov, and beautiful Dale Arden traveling in a rocket ship to another universe to save the planet. Along the way, in spellbinding, spectacular, and action-packed chapters Flash and his friends along with new found friends such as Prince Barin, Prince Thun, and the awesome King Vultan pool their resources together to fight the evils and armies of the merciless Ming of Mongo and the jealous treachery of his daughter Priness Aura(now she's a car!). This serial is not just a cut above most serials in terms of plot, acting, and budget - it is miles ahead in these areas. Produced by Universal Studios it has many former sets at its disposable like the laboratory set from The Bride of Frankenstein and the Opera House from The Phantom of the Opera just to name a few. The production values across the board are advanced, in my most humble opinion, for 1936. The costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are really creative and first-rate. We get hawk-men, shark men, lion men, high priests, creatures like dragons, octasacks, orangapoids, and tigrons(oh my!)and many, many other fantastic things. Are all of them believable and first-rate special effects? No way. But for 1936 most are very impressive. The musical score is awesome and the chapter beginnings are well-written, lengthy enough to revitalize viewer memories of the former chapter, and expertly scored. Director Frederick Stephani does a great job piecing everything together wonderfully and creating a worthy film for Alex Raymond's phenom comic strip. Lastly, the acting is pretty good in this serial. All too often serials have either no names with no talent surrounding one or two former talents - here most everyone has some ability. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a Shakespeare troupe by any means, but Buster Crabbe does a workmanlike, likable job as Flash. He is ably aided by Jean Arden, Priscella Lawson, and the rest of the cast in general with two performers standing out. But before I get to those two let me add as another reviewer noted, it must have been amazing for this serial to get by the Hayes Office. I see more flesh on Flash and on Jean Rogers and Priscella Lawson than in movies decades later. The shorts Crabbe(and unfortunately for all of us Professor Zarkov((Frank Shannon)) wears are about as form-fitting a pair of shorts guys can wear. The girls are wearing mid drifts throughout and are absolutely beautiful Jean Rogers may have limited acting talent but she is a blonde bombshell. Lawson is also very sultry and sensuous and beautiful. But for me the two actors that make the serial are Charles Middleton as Ming: officious, sardonic, merciless, and fun. Middleton is a class act. Jack \"\"Tiny\"\" Lipson plays King Vultan: boisterous, rousing, hilarious - a symbol for pure joy in life and the every essence of hedonism. Lipson steals each and every scene he is in. The plot meanders here, there, and everywhere - but Flash Gordon is the penultimate serial, space opera, and the basis for loads of science fiction to follow.

Here on the other hand these subjects are the focus of the show and I personally found myself evoking such works as Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix as reference points while watching and being surprised by how well the themes were being discussed. I think if you are a fan of the two I just mentioned or other films\/television shows, which deal with the subjects I referenced, I think you will find at least something here.<br \/><br \/>In terms of a starting point to explain how the situation we know in BSG came about I believe they handled it in a very interesting way, I especially liked how they explained where the Cylon's belief in one God came from and the creation of Caprica had just enough advanced and contemporary technology thrown in to make it appear in the future but not completely alien to us as viewers.<br \/><br \/>The only real weak points I noticed were the relationship between the Greystone parents and the actress who plays 'Lacy Rand'. While I like Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson individually, together their scenes seemed to lack chemistry, at this point it could simply be down to developing their characters, but this is something I think needs work.

{"text":"Connection-oriented transmission requires a setup phase in each involved node before any packet is transferred to establish the parameters of communication. The packets include a connection identifier rather than address information and are negotiated between endpoints so that they are delivered in order and with error checking. Address information is only transferred to each node during the connection set-up phase, when the route to the destination is discovered and an entry is added to the switching table in each network node through which the connection passes. This type of transmission is commonly used in applications that require reliable and continuous data transfer, such as large file transfers and streaming media. Once the connection is established, the data packets are transmitted in a sequential and reliable manner, ensuring that the data arrives at its destination intact and in the correct order.\n\nOne of the downsides of connection-oriented transmission is that it requires significant overhead to establish the connection, negotiate the packet parameters, and set up the routing table entries. This can result in higher latency and slower transmission speeds than connectionless transmission methods.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, connection-oriented transmission remains an essential part of modern networking, particularly in applications where reliability and order of delivery are critical.

{"text":"The main use for steam turbines is in electricity generation (in the 1990s about 90% of the world's electric production was by use of steam turbines) however the recent widespread application of large gas turbine units and typical combined cycle power plants has resulted in reduction of this percentage to the 80% regime for steam turbines. In electricity production, the high speed of turbine rotation matches well with the speed of modern electric generators, which are typically direct connected to their driving turbines. In marine service, (pioneered on the Turbinia), steam turbines with reduction gearing (although the Turbinia has direct turbines to propellers with no reduction gearbox) dominated large ship propulsion throughout the late 20th century, being more efficient (and requiring far less maintenance) than reciprocating steam engines. However modern engines can provide comparable speeds which is of even further advantage for large cruise ships.\n\nSteam power has traditionally been in high demand for generating large amounts of power for military propulsion purposes and on ships larger than a destroyer (in the Middle East and Eastern Europe). Today the marine industry produces about 12% of the world's electricity from steam power, mostly for electric power generation. There is no doubt some need for steam power in military application, however large ships have not been built to the scale required by the military and large electric plants have been introduced.\n\nOn land, large areas can be occupied that today would use electricity without the associated cost. This power is needed to heat water which can be used to produce steam for power generation or even for heating. The problem facing the land uses of electricity is to find ways of efficiently storing, transporting and delivering power to the buildings that need it.","prompt_len":854.0,"label":"gpt2","text_length":1854}
{"text":"we consider a dilute gas of dipole moments in an arbitrary harmonic trap and treat both the short - range , isotropic delta - interaction and the long - range , anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction perturbatively . Using perturbation theory, we can calculate the effects of the dipole-dipole interaction on the system. The dipole-dipole interaction introduces an anisotropy into the potential that the particles experience. It is important to note that this interaction is long-range, meaning that it has a non-zero effect even at large distances between particles.\n\nIn order to properly account for the effects of both the delta-interaction and the dipole-dipole interaction, we must first understand the limits of the system. If the dipole-dipole interaction dominates, the particles will tend to align themselves with the anisotropic potential, resulting in a system that is elongated in one direction. On the other hand, if the delta-interaction dominates, the particles will be essentially randomly oriented and the harmonic trap will dictate the shape of the system.\n\nTo properly describe the system, a combination of analytical and numerical techniques must be used. In the limit where the delta-interaction dominates, the system can be described using mean-field theory. However, in the more general case where both interactions are important, numerical simulations using techniques like Monte Carlo methods must be used.\n\nIn summary, by considering a dilute gas of dipole moments in an arbitrary harmonic trap, we have to take into account both the short-range, isotropic delta-interaction and the long-range, anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction perturbatively to accurately describe the system. The specific approach to analyzing the system depends on the relative strengths of these interactions, with a combination of analytical and numerical techniques being necessary.","prompt_len":217.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1887}

There was nothing in this film worth wasting your valuable time to watch it. This is something, which is easily forgotton after its viewing and cannot be recommended to anyone.\nIn my opinion the main reason that this film didn\u2019t work was because the main actress in it, Karisma Kapoor, is not a good actress whatsoever. The only reason that she was in the film was probably to cater for the masses of her fans and not for being able to act.

This approach has numerous advantages over traditional multipole methods, including increased accuracy, the ability to handle arbitrary geometries, and faster computational speed. The p@xmath0m@xmath0 method has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems in physics and chemistry, from calculating the electronic structure of atoms and molecules to modeling the behavior of fluids and solids.

There is much debate on this point, as some believe that it is a civil disobedient's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law. Ultimately, the decision to plead guilty or not guilty depends on a number of factors, including the individual's personal convictions, the potential consequences of a guilty verdict, and the likelihood of successfully challenging the unjust law in court. For some civil disobedients, the act of pleading guilty is a symbolic gesture of resistance and a means of drawing attention to the issue at hand. Others may choose to fight the charges in court, hoping to sway public opinion and challenge the legality of the unjust law. Whatever the decision, civil disobedients must be prepared for the potential consequences, including fines, imprisonment, and damage to their reputation.

{"text":"Part of the area at Llanberis in Gwynedd was home to a former RAF ammunitions store that was cleared in the 1970s. A report for the developers suggests some unexploded munitions could remain buried in the former quarry. But it said German nerve gas was removed and destroyed decades ago. The power company Snowdonia Pump Hydro (SPH) want to use the old Glyn Rhonwy quarry as the site of a 600 MWh pumped electricity storage facility. Those proposals are now being considered by the UK's Planning Inspectorate. However, opponents of the scheme in the area have concerns over possible contamination at the Glyn Rhonwy workings. The slate quarry was used as a secret munitions store during WW2, and later it was used to dispose of old and surplus bombs, bullets and grenades. Thousands of tonnes of weapons ended up in quarry pits there, prompting a massive RAF clean-up operation that only ended in the mid-1970s. The 'Concerned about Glyn Rhonwy' group said they believed that chemical weapons may have also been dumped or buried at the site.. A consultant's report confirmed that 70,000 German tabun nerve gas shells seized following WW2 were held at the Llanberis quarry for a short time. They were later moved to another facility near Caernarfon, and eventually dumped at sea. SPH commissioned consultants Zetica to examine issues surrounding unexploded munitions at the site, as part of the planning process. \"Nobody takes this issue lightly,\" stressed a spokesman for the hydro power company. \"We rely on the information in the Zetica report. It confirms that the German tabun bombs were held for a short time in a secure area at Glyn Rhonwy. There is no evidence that they were stored in any other area.\" The consultants stated that an official UK board of inquiry in the 1960s found \"all German chemical weapons appeared to have been successfully removed from RAF Llanberis\". But the Glyn Rhonwy campaigners have insisted that there can be no guarantees that every single tabun shell was removed. \"We think there is at least one discarded tabun bomb on the site,\" said Jeff Taylor, from the campaign group. He said that was based on documents uncovered in an archive relating to the quarry, which showed images of tabun bombs in Germany, and what appears to be the case of a similar bomb lying in a slate rock crevice. \"It is circumstantial evidence, but it is pretty damaging circumstantial evidence,\" argued Mr Taylor. Chemist Dr Dave Peskett, who has carried out research on the issue for the campaign group, said he had seen documents suggesting discarded mustard gas shells had also been dumped at the quarry in the past. The allegation is also disputed. But Dr Peskett added: \"It is not just the munitions that are the issue here. There's a huge pile of toxic residue there. \"Someone has to come in and remediate that site before any development takes place.\" The spokesman for SPH said tests had been carried out on water samples in the quarry in both 2012 and 2015, and no contamination was found. They added that \"in the unlikely event\" that unexploded ordnance was uncovered at Glyn Rhonwy, it would be dealt with in a \"rigorous\" process. \"It will ensure the safety of the people and the environment,\" said the official. BBC Wales has asked the Ministry of Defence to respond to concerns surrounding the site. However, a freedom of information request for details regarding the German nerve gas at Llanberis by the Concerned group was rejected stating that \"release of the information would enable ill-disposed persons or organisations to act against the national interest, and that therefore on balance the information should be withheld\".

Officers made 772 involuntary commitments to local hospitals.\"We're doing far more work related to service than we are enforcement,\" O'Toole said. \"Policing goes way beyond law enforcement, this underscores that.\"Sgt.

The temptation to fast forward through the slow parts is almost irresistible. The film is, unfortunately, like the yuppie lifestyle-- blandly unconvincing.\nThe story revolves around a young girl named Tracy, who loses her parents in a plane crash just before she is to attend college. Her aunt (Brooke Shields), whom she hardly knows, takes her in and Tracy has to start all over again. As she befriends a group of young women from the nearby boarding school for rich kids, she discovers the truth about her aunt's sexual past and herself.\nThere's nothing special about this movie.

Many fans were upset with the outcome, as several popular characters and major players in the Seven Kingdoms were killed off.

{"text":"Trade liberalization may shift economic inequality from a global to a domestic scale. When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper\u2013Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries.","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":1493}

{"text":"This is one of the finest films to come out of Hong Kong's 'New Wave' that began with Tsui Hark's \"\"ZU: Warriors of Magic Mountain\"\". Tsui set a tone for the New Wave's approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the New Wave (Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Wong Jing, Ching Siu Tung, etc.) accepted from then on as a given; namely, the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony, if not outright comedy. \"\"Burning Paradise\"\" put a stop to all that, and with a vengeance.<br \/><br \/>It's not that there isn't humor here; but it is a purely human humor, as with the aged Buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw. But this is just as humans are, not even Buddhist priests can be saints all the time.<br \/><br \/>When irony is at last introduced into the film, it is the nastiest possible, emanating from the 'abbot' of Red Lotus Temple, who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before. He is the very incarnation of Milton's Satan from \"\"Paradise Lost\"\": \"\"Better to rule in Hell than serve in heaven!\"\" And if he can't get to Satan's hell soon enough, he'll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule.<br \/><br \/>That's the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here: It's not that the Abbot just wants to kill people; he wants them to despair, to feel utterly hopeless, to accept his nihilism as all-encompassing reality. Thus there's a definite sense pervading the Red Temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the Temple itself - it has become all there is to the universe, and the Abbot, claiming mastery of infinite power, is in charge.<br \/><br \/>Of course, fortunately, the film doesn't end there. Though there are losses, the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails. (If you want to know how, see the film!) Yet there is no doubt that, in viewing this film, we visit hell.

Martin is a twisted individual for coming up with such a bloodthirsty concept, not so fast -- Martin admitted that his idea for the Red Wedding was inspired by two events from Scottish history.\"One was a case called The Black Dinner. The king of Scotland was fighting the Black Douglas clan. He reached out to make peace. He offered the young Earl of Douglas safe passage. He came to Edinburgh Castle and had a great feast. Then at the end of the feast, [the king's men] started pounding on a single drum. They brought out a covered plate and put it in front of the Earl and revealed it was the head of a black boar \u2014 the symbol of death. And as soon as he saw it, he knew what it meant. They dragged them out and put them to death in the courtyard,\" Martin told EW. \"The larger instance was the Glencoe Massacre. Clan MacDonald stayed with the Campbell clan overnight and the laws of hospitality supposedly applied. But the Campbells arose and started butchering every MacDonald they could get their hands on. No matter how much I make up, there's stuff in history that's just as bad, or worse.\"As Martin pointed out to EW, \"Hospitality laws were real in Dark Ages society. A host and guest were not allowed to harm each other even if they were enemies. By violating that law, the phrase is, they 'condemn themselves for all time.'\" So when the treacherous Frey family murdered the Starks at the wedding, they were breaking the sacred laws of hospitality (or \"guest right\" in Martin's fictional world) which dictate that any guest who has eaten bread and salt in their host's home is not allowed to be harmed. Despite Walder Frey being promised protection by the Lannisters after their betrayal of the Starks, we're crossing our fingers that the Freys get their just desserts for the messy feast.The Week dug up more information on the grisly historical events, the first of which inspired this poem by Sir Walter Scott:\"Edinburgh Castle, toune and towre,God grant thou sink for sin!And that e'en for the black dinnerEarl Douglas gat therein.\"Both instances saw the host families break the laws of hospitality in order to gain the upper hand politically, and the Campbell men actually stayed with the MacDonalds for two weeks before they were ordered to begin the massacre -- something that had been meticulously planned by the Campbells to avoid making the MacDonalds suspicious. 38 men were said to have been murdered at the Glencoe Massacre, while another 40 women and children died of exposure out in a blizzard as their homes were burned.

{"text":"\"If Europe fails on the question of refugees, then it won't be the Europe we wished for,\" she said. She was speaking after Austrian authorities arrested five suspected people smugglers along the country's eastern borders. On Thursday, 71 dead migrants were found near the Hungarian border. Austrian police say more than 200 others were found alive overnight. Ms Merkel said European countries must share the burden of refugees. Germany is the main destination for migrants arriving on the EU's eastern borders and expects the number of asylum seekers it receives to quadruple to about 800,000 in 2015. Mrs Merkel said \"Germany is a strong country - we will manage.\" But she said there would be \"no tolerance for those who question the dignity of other people\" after a spate of arson attacks on refugee shelters and anti-migrant demonstrations. \"The number of people... helping strangers get through cities and communities and even taking them into their homes is far greater than the number of xenophobes,\" she went on. Mrs Merkel's call for greater co-operation was echoed by French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who warned that Europe's migrant crisis would be a \"long and difficult challenge\". Also on Monday, trains from Budapest carrying hundreds of migrants were stopped at the Austrian frontier. Austria's rail service OeBB said the route from Budapest was facing severe disruption due to \"overcrowding\". Austrian police said they would turn back anyone on board who had made a request for asylum in Hungary - but it is not clear if this actually happened. Once in Austria, migrants would have two weeks to decide whether or not they wanted to claim refugee status there, police said. Trains were later allowed to proceed and hundreds of migrants arrived in Vienna on Monday evening. Many of them immediately boarded trains bound for Germany. Austria also introduced extra checks on vehicles entering from Hungary on Sunday evening, causing long traffic jams on Hungary's major roads leading to the Austrian border. The Austrian checks appear to undermine the EU's Schengen system, which normally allows unrestricted travel. But in exceptional circumstances countries can reintroduce border controls under Schengen. Austria's Interior Ministry told the BBC the checks would not be necessary if there were an agreement to distribute the migrants fairly. The head of the European Union's police agency, Rob Wainwright, said catching people smugglers would be easier with more \"effective\" border controls but added that the Schengen system had pros and cons. Five people have been detained in connection with the deaths of 71 people, most of them thought to be Syrians, in a lorry found last week on the A4 at Parndorf. Austria was shocked by the gruesome nature of the deaths. Thousands rallied on Monday demanding better rights for migrants. As well as the bodies in the lorry in Austria, hundreds more people drowned in the Mediterranean last week while trying to reach Europe from Libya. A record number of 107,500 migrants reached the EU's borders in July. The UN says the continuing conflict in Syria is a major factor behind the rise in migrant numbers. Greece, Italy and Hungary have particularly struggled with the surge of migrants from not only Syria but the rest of the Middle East and Africa. An extraordinary meeting of EU interior ministers is to be held on 14 September. Why is EU struggling with migrants and asylum? Some governments have refused to take in refugees and resisted EU proposals to agree on a common plan. Others are tightening their policies on asylum and border security, sometimes because of rising anti-immigration sentiment. On Sunday France condemned Hungary for building a razor-wire fence along its border with Serbia to try to keep out migrants travelling north from Greece via the Balkans.

This reliance on large prime numbers is a crucial aspect of public-key cryptography, as it provides a way to secure communications without relying on a shared secret between the communicating parties. However, advances in computing power and new mathematical discoveries have led to the need for even larger prime numbers to ensure the security of these algorithms.\n\nIn recent years, researchers have also explored the use of alternative cryptographic algorithms, such as elliptic curve cryptography, which offer similar levels of security with smaller key sizes. These algorithms have become increasingly popular in applications where resource constraints are a concern, such as mobile devices and embedded systems.\n\nDespite these advancements, the security of public-key cryptography remains a topic of ongoing research and debate.

She beat five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova 6-4 6-1 in the quarter-finals before seeing off fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska 6-0 6-4 to make the final. \"Even if I don't win, I really can take away that I've been really consistent and I want to continue that,\" Williams added.

{"text":"In a statement, the Defence Ministry said the report lacked \"technical proof\" when it used IP addresses to link hacking to a military unit. The report identified a Shanghai high-rise used by the military as the likely home of a hackers to whom it attributed multiple attacks on US companies. The US says it has repeatedly raised concerns with China about cyber theft. The Chinese ministry statement, posted on its website, said that many hacking attacks were carried out using hijacked IP addresses. By Jonathan MarcusBBC Diplomatic Correspondent The scale of the Chinese hacking alleged by the computer security firm Mandiant is striking. Until now the bulk of this hacking has been a digital version of old-fashioned industrial espionage - stealing designs and company secrets. But there is a more sinister side to this activity as well. Chinese hackers are alleged to have a growing interest in gaining access to key parts of the US infrastructure - gas lines, power grids and waterworks. President Barack Obama himself warned during his recent State of the Union address that the nature of the cyber threat was changing. Gaining access to critical systems is the key. Once inside the digital perimeter - especially if the intrusion is not identified, there is the possibility of causing real physical damage to the infrastructure that the computers control. There was no clear definition of what constituted a hacking attack, it went on, and as it was a cross-border, deceptive business, it was hard to pin down where attacks originated. It suggested that the \"everyday gathering\" of online information was being wrongly characterised as spying. The detailed report, released on Tuesday by US-based computer security company Mandiant, looked at hundreds of data breaches, most of which it attributed to what it termed \"Advanced Persistent Threat\" actors. The details it had uncovered, it said, showed that these groups were based primarily in China and that the Beijing government was aware of them. The most prolific of these actors was APT1, Mandiant said, describing it as \"one of the most prolific cyber espionage groups in terms of the sheer quantity of information stolen\". The firm said it had traced the hacking activities of APT1 to a Shanghai building. Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army \"is also located in precisely the same area\" and the actors had similar \"missions, capabilities and resources\", it added. APT1, it said, was staffed by hundreds of proficient English speakers. It had hacked into 141 companies across 20 industries, stealing information including blueprints, business plans, pricing documents, user credentials, emails and contact lists. Spokesman Jay Carney said the White House was \"aware\" of the Mandiant report and its contents. While not commenting directly, he described cyber espionage as a \"very important challenge\". \"We have repeatedly raised our concerns at the highest levels about cyber-theft with senior Chinese officials including in the military and we will continue to do so,\" he said. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, meanwhile, said that the issue came up \"in virtually every meeting we have with Chinese officials\". \"We consider this kind of activity a threat not only to our national security but also to our economic interests and [we are] laying out our concerns specifically so that we can see if there's a path forward,\" she said. China has long been suspected of a role in cyber hacking. But the issue has become more high-profile in recent months following widely reported hacks into media outlets including the New York Times - in that case apparently linked to a report by the paper on the wealth of relatives of outgoing Premier Wen Jiabao. The Chinese Defence Ministry statement pointed out that China was also a victim of hacking attacks. A Global Times editorial accused the US and its major allies of hyping up a China hacking \"threat\". \"China should refute the allegations of US company Mandiant with authoritative reports from its technology sector,\" it said. \"As a long-term counter-measure, China needs to encourage those institutions and individuals who have been subject to cyber-attacks from US IP addresses to stand up and tell the world what happened to them.\" ","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":4259}

The aim is to use the register to help usher in an era of \"personalised medicine\" that will see treatments matched to the exact type of cancer a patient has. Experts said it was \"great news\". The old definitions of cancer - breast, prostate, lung - are crumbling. Cancer starts with a mutation that turns a normal cell into one that divides uncontrollably and becomes a tumour. However, huge numbers of mutations can result in cancer and different mutations need different treatments. Research into the genetics of breast cancer means it is now thought of as at least 10 completely separate diseases, each with a different life expectancy and needing a different treatment. The national register will use data from patients at every acute NHS trust as well 11 million historical records. It will eventually track how each sub-type of cancer responds to treatment, which will inform treatment for future patients.

Despite what his defenders say, Sunday's defeat is another blow to the charismatic Mr Modi, who is arguably the party's biggest vote-getter and who attended 26 campaign rallies in Bihar ahead of the vote. The results make it clear that Mr Modi's vote-catching abilities are on the wane and voters are already holding him to the promises he made to them last year. For India's bedraggled opposition, the Bihar victory is a major shot in the arm. They will now be emboldened to challenge Mr Modi by forging alliances and change the narrative of Indian politics.

{"text":"EU Competition law has its origins in the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) agreement between France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Germany in 1951 following the second World War. The agreement aimed to prevent Germany from re-establishing dominance in the production of coal and steel as members felt that its dominance had contributed to the outbreak of the war. Article 65 of the agreement banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations, or mergers, and the abuse of a dominant position by companies. This was the first time that competition law principles were included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the trans-European model of competition law. In 1957 competition rules were included in the Treaty of Rome, also known as the EC Treaty, which established the European Economic Community (EEC). The Treaty of Rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the EEC through the \"institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted\". The two central provisions on EU competition law on companies were established in article 85, which prohibited anti-competitive agreements, subject to some exemptions, and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position. The treaty also established principles on competition law for member states, with article 90 covering public undertakings, and article 92 making provisions on state aid. Regulations on mergers were not included as member states could not establish consensus on the issue at the time.","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":1576}

Solicitor Ayub Bhailok, who is assisting Freemont, said: \"There is no justification for the CPO. There is a commercially viable scheme possible and the confidence in the market can only improve as time progresses.\" Freemont took over the property from Acebench Investments Ltd, of which he is a director and which paid \u00a3310,000 for the hospital in 2003. The company's own planning consent expired in 2009 after hopes of progress were halted during the building slump the previous year, the hearing was told. Mr Bhailok claimed that since 2009, the council and Prince's Regeneration Trust had been determined to repossess the site and press ahead with their own scheme without involving him. In 2011, Denbighshire council served an urgent works notice on the British Virgin Islands-based company after becoming frustrated at the deterioration in the condition of the listed buildings. It then carried out the work and last October a public inquiry was held into the council's claim for \u00a3900,000 to be refunded by Freemont for the work.

Mr Dunsby said action should be taken against those responsible for the failings. \"Those guys all need to be come in to order and they need to face some accountability,\" he said. \"What form of punishment, I just don't know, I just know they have to be made accountable.\" \"It shouldn't end here. Three young lads died, one of them was my son, but at the end of the day it could have been probably a lot more... were the Army lucky? Yes they probably were.\" \"I'd like to think that whatever happened that day, the Army benefit from it because we don't want it [to] happen again,\" he added. The Army accepted the risks of the July 2013 exercise were not managed carefully but said changes had been made. On Wednesday, Prime Minister David Cameron \"We now need to study the coroner's conclusions very, very carefully and make sure that this can't possibly happen again. \"And I know the Army will also hold its own service inquiry as soon as all the civil investigations have been completed. It's an absolutely tragic case and we will learn from it.\" Delivering her inquest conclusion on Tuesday, coroner Louise Hunt said she had a \"general concern\" the MoD still did not have a clear plan and guidance for heat illness. \"I remain concerned about the completion of risk assessments and whether or not the culture within the organisation has changed,\" she said. She will issue a Preventing Future Deaths report within 10 days, which could include recommendations for changes. The MoD must respond to the report. Defence Minister Penny Mordaunt said changes had been implemented since the men's deaths and the MoD would continue to work hard to ensure the code of practice is understood and followed. Failed attempts were made on the hills to save L\/Cpl Roberts while L\/Cpl Maher had already died by the time help arrived. Cpl Dunsby, 31, of Bath, was found collapsed near the finish and died in hospital two weeks later. The Health and Safety Executive is continuing its investigation into the circumstances surrounding the reservists' deaths. ","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":2733}

{"text":"You look at your phone but the number is not in your contact list. So is it important enough to run out of the room with your phone held half-up in signal to the others that this is a call too important to miss? Truecaller may be able to help with that. \"If you download Truecaller you will never have to worry about saving contacts to your phone book, everything will be in the cloud.\" says Alan Mamedi, chief executive and co-founder of Truecaller. He recalls his own phonecall-in-a-meeting dilemma as being his motivation to help create the app, which he believes could be on every smartphone across the globe. \"If you receive a call from a number you don't have we'll show that information, if there is a sales call coming in we will warn you about that. \"Or if you just want to make an outbound call in a much better way; by knowing if your friend is available or your friend is on a phone call then you can use Truecaller.\" Truecaller uses a database of more than two billion phone numbers to tell you who is phoning you. On certain smartphone operating systems it will show that person's name, where they are from, and in many cases even display their picture. It then uses crowd-sourced information to recognise nuisance calls and prevent them ever taking a second more of your time. \"In the UK or US every sixth call would be a spam caller,\" says Nami Zarringhalam, co-founder of Truecaller. \"People in general get more spam calls than they receive calls from family members. So this is a big issue we're pinpointing and providing a solution for.\" Alan Mamedi, goes on to explain how the data is collected: \"If you receive a call from a number and we can't detect it, then you, as a user, can actually add that information. \"But we also partner with different data providers to fill in the empty gaps\". However according to Nishanth Sastry, senior lecturer in the centre for telecommunications research at King's College, London, it's this aspect of the company that is open to scrutiny. If a phone user shares the names and numbers in their contacts book with an app, that then relays those details to the world, it's not that phone user's information to share, he says. \"It's not their own information they are sharing, it is their friends' information they are sharing. \"And they are sharing this information with people that they don't know. That's a privacy issue for friends - who have never seen the terms and conditions of Truecaller.\" Alan Mamedi, doesn't believe this to be an issue: \"We made it super easy for anyone to un-list their number on our website, we don't require any verification or such. \"This has been the case since day one. It's part of our philosophy that it should be super simple to just un-list your number. \"You just go on our website and then it's gone forever.\" Now Alan, Nami and their team occupy a series of plush offices. It's a  long way from where they first began back in 2009. \"We were sitting in my one room apartment, which was basically just my kitchen and bedroom in the same room,\" says Nami. \"We started to build Truecaller with servers that we had bought, building an application for our own mobile phones.\" They then decided to release it and within the first week say they had 10,000 new users. \"We decided to start a company and so resigned from our full-time jobs,\" says Alan. \"Since then we've grown really, really fast. \"We have 200 million users globally. Just last year we went from 100 million users to 200 million. We've definitely seen an exponential growth globally, especially in the emerging markets.\" Truecaller, he says, also has a few, less obvious uses. \"One of the cases we've seen in India is women who before they jump in a cab actually verify the cab driver who is calling them. \"We with some confidence can say, hey this is a cab driver who's calling you. Or even say if you have friends in common with this cab driver - and that adds a safety layer which we never thought about in the past.\" Despite adding 63 new users a minute on average since its creation in 2009, Alan has even bigger ambitions. \"The number one app that people are using everyday is your phone app and no one has innovated in that space. \"Truecaller is changing that.

{"text":"The clashes - said to involve heavy artillery and tanks - took place in Maryinka and Krasnohorivka, outside the rebel-held city of Donetsk. There were reports of multiple injuries in the towns held by Ukraine's army. Ukraine accused the rebels of launching a full-scale offensive in violation of a truce. The separatists deny this. The BBC's Tom Burridge near Maryinka describes the fighting as the heaviest since the ceasefire signed in February in Minsk, Belarus. Clashes between government troops and the rebels have recently intensified along the line of separation. The Ukrainian government, Western leaders and Nato all say there is clear evidence that Russia is helping the rebels in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions with heavy weapons and soldiers. Independent experts echo that accusation. Moscow denies it, insisting that any Russians serving with the rebels are volunteers. More than 6,400 people have been killed in fighting in eastern Ukraine that began in April 2014 when rebels seized large parts of the two eastern regions. This followed Russia's annexation of the Crimea peninsula. In other developments: Ukrainian officials say the clashes in Maryinka and Krasnohorivka, just west of Donetsk, began with heavy artillery shelling by the rebels early in the morning. At least seven government soldiers were wounded during the intense fighting, government sources said. Ukraine's military later accused the rebels of staging a full-scale offensive, in violation of the Minsk agreements. We could hear the battle rage around Maryinka, which is by a main crossing point from government-controlled eastern Ukraine into rebel-held territory. There was a near constant barrage of artillery throughout the afternoon. Smoke rose on the horizon. And on three occasions we saw Ukrainian troops fire multiple rocket launchers, known as Grads, towards rebel positions. The Ukrainians also accused the rebels of using Grads, which indiscriminately shower a large area of ground with rockets, and are banned from exclusion zones near the frontline, under the Minsk agreement. The exact number of dead might only emerge with time, but both sides appear to have taken significant losses. Who is now in control of Maryinka is unclear. If Maryinka has been taken by the rebels, it would appear to be the most significant gain in territory since the Ukrainian military lost control of the town of Debaltseve, just after the Minsk deal was agreed. Wednesday's violence will sow even more distrust and will shake the confidence of leaders and diplomats in France and Germany, who are trying to work with Russia and Ukraine to broker real peace. It said more than 10 tanks and up to 1,000 rebel fighters had attacked Ukrainian positions in Maryinka. Ukrainian troops, it added, had been forced to use artillery to repel the offensive. Meanwhile, rebel leaders accused Ukraine of shelling across the line of contact. \"This is Kiev's local provocation, an attempt to break deep into the DPR [the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic] from Maryinka. All of this is local, not large-scale combat clashes,\" rebel deputy defence minister Eduard Basurin was quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. Rebel sources also reported on a number of injuries among their forces. Maryinka - a strategically-located town along a major road - has been devastated by months of heavy fighting. The rebels have accused Ukrainian troops stationed in the town of repeatedly shelling Donetsk - a claim denied by the Ukrainian military. Despite the ceasefire, rebel leaders have said they want to seize the parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions currently held by government forces.

{"text":"An oscillating cylinder steam engine is a variant of the simple expansion steam engine which does not require valves to direct steam into and out of the cylinder. Instead of valves, the entire cylinder rocks, or oscillates, such that one or more holes in the cylinder line up with holes in a fixed port face or in the pivot mounting (trunnion). These engines are mainly used in toys and models, because of their simplicity, but have also been used in full size working engines, mainly on ships where their compactness is valued. One of the benefits of the oscillating cylinder steam engine is that it is self-starting. The rocking motion of the cylinder creates the necessary clearance for the piston to move freely and start the engine. This makes it an ideal choice for use in small toys and models where ease of use is important. \n\nHowever, the design also has its limitations. The oscillating cylinder steam engine is less efficient than other types of steam engines because it does not allow for full exploitation of the steam's energy. The capacity of the steam engine is also limited due to the small size and compactness of the engine. \n\nDespite these limitations, oscillating cylinder steam engines continue to be used today in a variety of applications, including in miniature models and in small-scale industrial settings. Their simplicity and ease of use make them a popular choice for hobbyists and enthusiast alike.","prompt_len":528.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1429}

{"text":"They are physically worn out by their multitude of tasks, morally exhausted by the constant criticism, and now - more than ever before - anxious for their very lives. \"To the universal fatigue, there has been added a new element since Monday - fear,\" says Jean-Marc Bailleul of the SCSI union. The lot of France's 240,000 police and gendarmes is certainly not a happy one. Since jihadist terror struck Paris in November they have been on extra duties for the post-attacks state of emergency. Holidays were cancelled, unpaid overtime is accumulating. Add to that the migrant camps near Calais, which have required several companies of riot police. Plus: And then on Monday came the shocking news of two officers murdered by an Islamist in Magnanville, west of Paris. It is small wonder that many officers feel they are at the end of their tether. President Francois Hollande recognises the strains. At Friday's ceremony in Versailles for the murdered police couple, Jean-Baptiste Salvaing and Jessica Schneider, he paid tribute to the dedication of the service. And he said he would meet some of the demands of police unions to ensure their better protection. For example, even after the state of emergency runs out next month, officers will continue to be allowed to carry handguns when off duty.  And there will be extra, so far unspecified, measures to safeguard police anonymity. The greatest fear after Monday's murders is that lone-wolf Islamists will target police officers whom they have come up against personally in the past as petty criminals. \"We've all at one time or another had contracts put on our heads by robbers or gang-leaders,\" says Olivier Berton of the Alliance union. \"Regularly they send out juniors to check out the cars parked outside the police station, to get the registration numbers.\" Officers are now under standing instructions not to wear uniform when off duty, not to travel alone on public transport and to remove as much personal information as possible from social media. But in addition to physical exhaustion and the stress caused by fear, many policemen and women are exasperated by the conditions under which they work, and the abuse which they say is increasingly directed at them. In Tuesday's Paris protest, for example, at least 28 officers were injured by demonstrators throwing projectiles.  Unions say the number was much higher. Slogans were chanted such as \"One Policeman, One Bullet\", \"Police - France Hates You\" and \"Roast Chicken - Going Free\". (The word for chicken - \"poulet\" - is slang for policeman.) According to police representatives, anti-police hatred is at large in the land, reminiscent of some of the country's darkest days of social discord. Indeed it was at a demonstration called by police last month to protest against anti-police violence that a police car was attacked and set on fire. The occupants escaped, but shocking video footage of the incident went round the world. Critics of the police say they have themselves to blame,  pointing to other videos that show officers acting with unnecessary force to control or beat protesters. But according to Jean-Marc Berliere, author of a history of the French police, \"when a cop hits a kid, the video is immediately on YouTube with a million views.  It all helps build the anti-police culture. \"But you never see videos of the daily violence that the police have to suck up.\" The police have a not entirely enviable place in French popular culture.  From before the Revolution they have been associated with the imposition - often brutal - of central government authority. Every now and again there is an outburst of popular feeling in the contrary direction. At the liberation of Paris in 1944,  the police were hailed for leading the anti-German insurrection. And last year - after the death of three officers in the Charlie Hebdo Islamist attacks - the police enjoyed a surge in support. Recruitment went up sharply and the ageing left-wing rocker Renaud - once the scourge of the French police - even penned a song called I Embraced A Cop. After this week's murders, sympathy for the force is once again growing. For the police, that is a small consolation for increasingly difficult times.

{"text":"the idea of  receptor mosaics  is that proteins may form complex and dynamic networks with respect to time and composition . For example, proteins might be grouped together based on their functions and can therefore have distinct roles within that network at any one time. Similarly, the different roles taken by individual proteins in this network might change according to which target is being targeted. The presence of a specific receptor in a molecular network can change who is in that network and who is not. In human tissue, the number of receptors for different compounds are variable but are similar to those in mammalian tissues (Reed et al, 1998). In fact, this variation is even greater in a single cell compared to a mammalian tissue. However, in other mammalian cells the number of receptors for a specific compound depends on the type of cell (for example, in the human prostate) and might be more variable. The number of receptors may also change over the course of a single development and between organisms (Table ) (Kan et al, 1996). Table 19: Changes of receptor expression in a mammalian cell after binding to different substrates Open in a separate window In turn, changes in receptor presence in receptors might lead to changes in the binding and secretion of certain proteins depending on the particular receptor, ligand or molecular mechanism associated with the interaction between the receptor-receptor. In the mammalian liver, the amount of receptors for bile acids is increased during development and these increase relative to the liver of the mature animal (Reed et al, 1998). Similarly, the quantity of liver lipid in a tissue increases as a function of age, suggesting that the changes in liver lipid that occur in the adult human liver are not an intrinsic effect of aging but rather are due","prompt_len":124.0,"label":"gpt2","text_length":1826}

Yet at the heart of it all, each character maintains a streak of decency - moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions. \"\"Contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life.\"\" How true these words are. Watson's Anne Manning is at the core of this intrigue - she's the central conscience that the other three latched on. She is the decency undeterred. <br \/><br \/>The circumstances of lies are to each its own: one to defend one's professional name; one to hold back due to family\/partner pressure; one simply don't want to face the consequence; one ironically can't believe the truth and lies to save friendship. These are all precarious situations. There lies the intrigue - fascinating to watch how each tackles truth and lies. Contradictions, indeed. In spite of the seeming dishonor, decency and heart remain strong. <br \/><br \/>The treatment of the subject involved and how each of the character behaves are masterfully delivered simple with clarity. It's not sensational or complex as another film \"\"Where the Truth Lies\"\" 2005. Credits due to Fellowes' writing and the nuanced performances of both Watson and Wilkinson. There is warmth somehow that comes through the seemingly boldface or frustratingly hidden lies. Beneath it all, human frailty not excluded, they meant well. And following along with the story, the turn of events provided satisfaction and smiles to how the two Manning's seem to have grown and matured in their relationship. <br \/><br \/>You might say there's no obvious action drama or thrilling scenes in \"\"Separate Lies,\"\" yet the intrigue is there and it will hold your attention. The deserving production efforts include cinematography by Tony Pierce-Roberts (a veteran to the Merchant-Ivory films) and music by Stanislas Syrewicz, with mood and tone reminiscent of composer Zbignew Priesner (of filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski's Trois Couleurs, especially: Bleu 1993.)

{"text":"The official stats back that up - and the causes were largely a surge in benefit payments to those who lost jobs or whose income collapsed in the Great Recession, and the introduction of a new top rate of tax. That 50% new top rate was announced by Labour in 2010, however, and reduced to 45% by George Osborne as Chancellor. So to be clear, the reduction in inequality wasn't a great cause championed by the coalition of Tories and LibDems and pursued with vigour by the adoption of novel policies. What is more, a new study by the OECD, shows this narrowing of inequality was relatively short lived. It says that in the UK, as measured by the so-called Gini coefficient and by the ratio of incomes of the top 10% of earners to the bottom 10%, inequality lessened between 2007 and 2011 and then increased again by 2013 (though not back to where it was in 2007). Analysts such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies predict that, as a result of expected benefit cuts and reforms by the current government, the income gap between rich and poor will widen further in the coming few years. What may matter as much as the trend is that the UK is shown to be a significantly less equal place than the average of rich developed countries. So the average Gini score for 34 countries in its survey is .315, whereas the coefficient for the UK is a higher and less equal .351. There aren't many rich countries with higher Gini scores than the UK. The US is the most important, with a .401 rating. Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and France all have much lower Gini scores. Even countries we think of as being similar to us in culture and economic approach, such as Australia, Ireland and New Zealand, have markedly narrower gaps between rich and poor than we do. So the UK is among the less equal of the world's developed countries. The 90\/10 ratio, the multiple of earnings of the top 10% of earners versus the bottom 10%, tells a similar story - it is 10.5 for the UK, but just 6.6 for more egalitarian Germany. That said, the ratio between top and bottom 10% is a staggering 18.8 for the US, or almost twice the OECD average of 9.6. All that said, there is no need to flagellate ourselves that widening inequality here bucked the global trend. Inequality may be more pronounced in the UK than elsewhere, but that gap between rich and poor has been widening almost everywhere. As the OECD's report \"In it together, why less inequality benefits all\", says, an average 90\/10 ratio of 7:1 for rich nations in the 1980s became 8:1 in the 90s to 9.6 today. And what it argues - many will say persuasively - is that talking about worsening inequality is not to engage in the politics of envy, but to discuss economic failure or a big missed opportunity. It says that the argument against inequality is about a good deal more than than the social and political costs, the damage to social cohesion. It purports to demonstrate that economic growth diminishes as the gap between rich and poor widens - so everyone suffers from worsening inequality. The main theory it puts forward for why inequality and growth are negatively correlated is that poorer people invest less in their own education and self improvement - which is why its main anti-inequality prescriptions are government investment in skills and education, and a focus on a promoting better quality jobs. Strikingly it isn't saying that the best way to greater equality and faster growth is to soak the rich. Instead it wants activism focused on raising the living standards of the poorest, especially the poorest 40%. It calculates, therefore, that if living standards in the UK for poorer people were raised to the relative levels of France - that if so-called \"bottom inequality\" was reduced by half of a standard deviation (to use the jargon) - annual growth in national income or GDP would rise by 0.3% every year for 25 years. That's not to be sniffed at. It would represent increasing our current growth rate by around 13%. However, you may have noticed - in the perhaps unfortunate choice by the OECD of France as the comparator with the UK - that it is easier said than done to promote growth by reducing inequality. Because it won't have escaped your notice that more equal France has been a slower growing economy than the UK's for some years (just as unequal America has been much faster growing than more egalitarian Japan). Some would argue that the UK's putative economic success is due in part to a more deregulated economy, smaller welfare state and lower tax burden than in France - but those putative British virtues arguably tend to create the conditions for a widening in the gap between rich and poor. Or to put it another way, there is a tightrope to walk here: inequality may be bad for growth and general prosperity, but the wrong kind of equality-promoting policies can also be toxic for growth and incomes.

The study analyzed the availability and distribution of healthcare facilities that provided cardiovascular services such as hospitals, clinics, and specialized healthcare centers. Geographic information systems (GIS) were used to map the location of these facilities and calculate the coverage and accessibility of cardiovascular healthcare services across all 31 provinces in Iran. The results showed significant disparities in the distribution of healthcare facilities that provided cardiovascular services in different regions of Iran. In particular, provinces in Northern and Central Iran had higher coverage and accessibility to cardiovascular health services, while provinces in the South and Southeast had lower access.\n\nThe study highlighted the importance of addressing the unequal distribution of cardiovascular health services in Iran to ensure that all individuals have timely access to the necessary healthcare services to prevent heart damage and improve their health outcomes. The findings of the study can help policymakers to allocate resources and improve infrastructure to ensure that all regions of Iran have adequate cardiovascular health services.

The meeting is being hosted by the Northern Ireland Sports Forum and a number of sporting bodies are expected to attend the talks. The Northern Ireland Commonwealth Games Council intends to tell the federation it is still committed to the Games and hopes the issue of funding can be resolved. Last week, the Department of the Economy told the BBC that it was unable to sign off on the Games because they were \"not value for money\".

Our analysis reveals that the optimal CBM policy balances the cost of replacing the component at failure instances with the cost of performing preventive maintenance. By taking into account the timing and cost of the scheduled and unscheduled maintenance opportunities, we show that a control-limit policy is the most cost-effective solution. This approach sets a threshold for the component's condition that triggers a preventive maintenance action when the condition crosses the control limit. The control limit is dynamically adjusted based on how long it is until the next scheduled opportunity for maintenance.\n\nWe also evaluate the impact of uncertainties in the component's failure probability, the cost of maintenance, and the effectiveness of CBM. We find that the optimal policy is robust to varying levels of uncertainty and remains a control-limit policy. This suggests that the optimal CBM policy is suitable for real-world implementation and that it can deliver significant cost savings compared to traditional OEM service and maintenance practices.\n\nOverall, our study demonstrates the benefits of incorporating CBM into service and maintenance practices for complex systems. By leveraging data and analytics, we can optimize the maintenance schedule to minimize costs and maximize equipment availability, reliability, and performance.

{"text":"If you spend time in or around the programming community you probably hear the term \"P versus NP\" rather frequently. Unfortunately, even many with formal computer science training have a weak understanding of the concept.So here's a simple and concise explanation:P vs. NP The P vs. NP problem asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer. (Wikipedia)So let's figure out what we mean by P and NP.P problems are easily solved by computers, and NP problems are not easily solvable, but if you present a potential solution it's easy to verify whether it's correct or not.As you can see from the diagram above, all P problems are NP problems. That is, if it's easy for the computer to solve, it's easy to verify the solution. So the P vs NP problem is just asking if these two problem types are the same, or if they are different, i.e. that there are some problems that are easily verified but not easily solved.It currently appears that P \u2260 NP, meaning we have plenty of examples of problems that we can quickly verify potential answers to, but that we can't solve quickly. Let's look at a few examples:A traveling salesman wants to visit 100 different cities by driving, starting and ending his trip at home. He has a limited supply of gasoline, so he can only drive a total of 10,000 kilometers. He wants to know if he can visit all of the cities without running out of gasoline. (from Wikipedia)A farmer wants to take 100 watermelons of different masses to the market. She needs to pack the watermelons into boxes. Each box can only hold 20 kilograms without breaking. The farmer needs to know if 10 boxes will be enough for her to carry all 100 watermelons to market. (from Wikipedia)All of these problems share a common characteristic that is the key to understanding the intrigue of P versus NP: In order to solve them you have to try all combinations.This is why the answer to the P vs. NP problem is so interesting to people. If anyone were able to show that P is equal to NP, it would make difficult real-world problems trivial for computers.P vs. NP deals with the gap between computers being able to quickly solve problems vs. just being able to test proposed solutions for correctness. As such, the P vs. NP problem is the search for a way to solve problems that require the trying of millions, billions, or trillions of combinations without actually having to try each one. Solving this problem would have profound effects on computing, and therefore on our society.Feb 7, 2017 \u2014 Added Wikipedia attributions.March 2, 2014 \u2014 Cleaned up some of the explanation to avoid confusion.","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":2665}

{"text":"28 May 2016Until recently, the concept of generators, or resumable functions, seemed to me like a cute idea with only niche use cases. Sure, I had heard that generators in python and javascript could make certain things much nicer, but how often does one really need to have what appears to be nothing more than a fancy iterator? It wasn't until I followed this Rust RFC thread that the true potential of generators in Rust started to dawn on me. Today they are my personal number-one most-desired new feature for the language, mostly because I believe they are the biggest missing piece in Rust's async story.But how are generators relevant to async at all?To understand that, let's first imagine what generators might look like in Rust. We start with a trait definition (borrowed from eddyb's comment in the above-linked thread):pub enum Yield < T , R > { Value ( T ), Return ( R ) } pub trait Generator { type Value ; type Return ; fn next ( & mut self ) -> Yield < Self :: Value , Self :: Return > ; }So a generator looks a lot like an iterator. You can ask it for the next value until you reach its end, signalled by Return . The interesting part is that there is a special way to construct values that implement Generator . For example:fn fib_with_sum ( n : usize ) -< u64 > -> u64 { let mut a = 0 ; let mut b = 1 ; let mut sum = 0 ; for _ in 0 . .n { yield a ; \/\/ <--- new keyword \"yield\" sum += a ; let next = a + b ; a = b ; b = next ; } return sum ; }Here I've used some strawman syntax fn foo() -<T>-> R , which denotes that foo is a generator function that produces some number of T values and then finishes by producing an R . The yield keyword inside of a generator function means that a Yield::Value() should be produced and the generator should be paused. When you call fib_with_sum() , the value you get back is a generator, which can be used by calling next() , like this:let mut g = fib_with_sum ( 5 ); g .next (); \/\/ Yield::Value(0) g .next (); \/\/ Yield::Value(1) g .next (); \/\/ Yield::Value(1) g .next (); \/\/ Yield::Value(2) g .next (); \/\/ Yield::Value(3) g .next (); \/\/ Yield::Return(7)Another thing that we might want to do is to have one generator delegate to another generator. The yield from construction allows that:fn sub_gen ( n : u64 ) -< u64 > -> bool { for i in 0 . .n { yield i } return n == 3 ; } fn gen () -< u64 > -> () { for j in 0 .. { if yield from sub_gen ( j ) { return j ; } } }Running this gives:let mut g = gen (); g .next (); \/\/ Yield::Value(0) g .next (); \/\/ Yield::Value(0) g .next","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":2528}
{"text":"I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling \"\"Gentleman Jim\"\" the best boxing movie ever made. That is the Robert Wise\/Paul Newman flick \"\"Somebody Up There Likes Me.\"\" That movie might be number 1, but \"\"Gentleman Jim\"\" is a close number 2.<br \/><br \/>The movie doesn't just chronicle the rise of James J. Corbett, it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition. In the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare-knuckle rules to the more \"\"gentlemanly\"\" days of the gloved, Marquis of Queensbury rules. And the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability.<br \/><br \/>\"\"Gentleman Jim\"\" is not a realistic look at those days. It is romanticized and, yes, even a bit hokey at times. But always delightfully so. Errol Flynn is perfect as the \"\"Gentleman\"\" Jim who really isn't a \"\"gentleman\"\" at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family. Alexis Smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has a love\/hate relationship (and we all know it is, of course, love that will win that match in the end).<br \/><br \/>At the end of \"\"Gentleman Jim\"\" the great John L Sullivan (whose famous line was NOT \"\"I can lick any man in the world\"\" of course...romanticism again) hands over his belt to Corbett.

The survey consisted of a set of questions related to forensic odontology and the utilization of its knowledge during crime scene investigation. The questions were designed to test the awareness and knowledge of the police personnel regarding the collection and production of evidence. The survey also aimed to evaluate their understanding of the role of forensic odontology in identifying the accused or victim.\n\nThe survey revealed that a significant percentage of police officers were unaware of the role of forensic odontology in evidence collection and identification. However, there were also a considerable number of officers who had some understanding of forensic odontology and its importance in the legal system.\n\nBased on the results of the survey, it was suggested that training programs should be designed for police personnel to enhance their knowledge and awareness of forensic odontology. Such programs could include lectures, practical exercises, and workshops to provide hands-on experience in the field.\n\nBy developing an understanding of forensic odontology, police personnel could better collect and produce evidence and increase the chances of identifying the accused or victim. With this knowledge, they could also act as expert witnesses in court and provide valuable forensic dental evidence.\n\nIn conclusion, the survey highlights the need for greater awareness and knowledge about forensic odontology among police personnel.

Lung cancer was the most costly form of the disease. The team from the University of Oxford and King's College London analysed data from each of the 27 nations in the EU in 2009. The showed the total cost was 126bn euro and of that 51bn (\u00a343bn) euro was down to healthcare costs including doctors' time and drug costs. Lost productivity, because of work missed through sickness or dying young, cost 52bn (\u00a344bn) euro while the cost to families of providing care was put at 23bn (\u00a319.5bn) euro. Overall, richer countries, such as Germany and Luxembourg, spent more on cancer treatment per person than eastern European countries such as Bulgaria and Lithuania. Lung cancer accounted for more than a tenth of all cancer costs in Europe. The deadly cancer tends to affect people at an earlier age than other cancers so the lost productivity through early deaths is a major factor. However, the overall economic burden is behind the costs of dementia and cardiovascular disease. An EU-wide study, by the same research group, showed cardiovascular diseases, including high blood pressure and stroke, cost 169bn euro (\u00a3144bn) a year while dementia cost 189bn euro (\u00a3169bn)  in just 15 countries in Western Europe. Dementia has very high costs associated with long-term care while cardiovascular diseases include such a wide range of conditions it affects many more people than cancer. One of the researchers, Dr Ramon Luengo-Fernandez, from the Health Economics Research Centre at the University of Oxford, said: \"By estimating the economic burden of several diseases it will be possible to help allocate public research funding towards the diseases with the highest burden and highest expected returns for that investment.\" Prof Richard Sullivan, from King's College London, said: \"It is vital that decision-makers across Europe use this information to identify and prioritise key areas. \"More effective targeting of investment may prevent health care systems from reaching breaking point - a real danger given the increasing burden of cancer - and in some countries better allocation of funding could even improve survival rates.\" Sara Osborne, head of policy at Cancer Research UK, said: \"The financial impact that cancer has on the economy across Europe due to people dying prematurely from the disease and time off work remains a huge burden. \"This study reinforces why research is vital to improve our understanding of the causes of cancer - so that we lessen the impact of the disease and develop better ways to prevent and treat the illness. \"We also need to understand why the UK's cancer mortality rates remain higher than many EU countries despite a similar spend on cancer care.\" ","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":2905}

I would smell all the time. I felt helpless,\" she says. \"Some neighbours and relatives despised me. Others made fun of me.

At the time, she was six months pregnant with her first baby. Living with an elderly father-in-law and with no professional antenatal care at hand, Razia's pregnancy became her nightmare. The traumatic episode left her in a condition she describes as \"worse than being blind\". Obstetric fistula is little known in Europe and the US where it has been virtually wiped out because of improved obstetric care. The 'cursed' women living in shame Fistula in Uganda But an estimated two million women around the world still suffer from the devastating impact of this condition. Many of them belong to the most marginalised communities in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Pakistan has one of the worst maternal mortality rates in the region and its public health care suffers from deep-rooted corruption and institutional  inefficiencies. Growing income disparities mean few can afford costly private health services in urban areas, while many rural poor, especially in Sindh and Balochistan provinces, can't even access basic health services. \"Obstetric fistula is a condition which affects the poorest of the poor women with limited or no access to basic health care and education,\" points out Dr Sajjad Siddiqui, Pakistan project manager for the global End Fistula Campaign. And because the patients are usually without a voice and out of sight, no-one cares about them, he says. In recent years, Pakistan has reported up to 5,000 new obstetric fistula patients annually. The number is based on women who sought help or somehow came in contact with Dr Siddiqui and his team at the seven free fistula treatment centres set up by the UN Population Fund. Many more go on suffering quietly in shame - for years, sometimes decades - not knowing that the condition is treatable through surgery, say experts. That was the case with Razia who went through the pain and humiliation that comes with vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistula. Ostracised and stigmatised, the choice before her was to die a lonely miserable death in the village, or seek help. \"I thought of committing suicide, but something always prevented me,\" she says. \"I guess I never fully gave up hope.\" So, one day, despite her visual impairment and incontinence, Razia - all alone - left her village and took the long train journey south to the port city of Karachi. Here, she was lucky to end up somehow at the country's National Fistula Centre at Koohi Goth charity hospital. \"Razia's was a particularly difficult case, given what she had been through,\" says Dr Shershah Syed, who has spent nearly two decades treating fistula patients all over the country. \"But I was struck by her courage and resilience and took her in as a challenge.\" Over the next several months, Razia was cared for and offered free treatment at the hospital. And after a series of operations, she started to get her life back and reintegrate herself back into the community. Along the way, she remarried. And when her doctors made it clear to the couple that she would never be able to conceive again, she adopted a girl from her extended family. But earlier this year, she once again defied the odds and surprised herself and her doctors when it turned out she was pregnant. \"We couldn't believe it! It's extremely rare for a woman with her complications to conceive again. And yet she did it,\" says Dr Syed. This time, Razia received the antenatal care she deserved and through a caesarean section gave birth prematurely to a baby girl. \"I am so happy now. This little bundle of joy has made me forget all my pain and suffering,\" she says. Razia now lives in Karachi with her new husband, a handyman\/painter, her adopted daughter and her newborn baby. Still, she worries about thousands of other women suffering from the condition. As a fistula survivor, every now and then she volunteers at Koohi Goth Hospital to encourage other women to take charge of their lives. \"Never give up hope,\" she tells them. However, despite individual successes, what's really worrying Pakistan's small group of fistula experts is the rise in the reported cases of iatrogenic fistula. This kind of injury is caused by the negligence of health practitioners while performing hysterectomies and caesarean sections. The victims are usually mature women being operated on by unqualified and untrained health practitioners. \"This is becoming a bigger concern for us,\" says Dr Siddiqui. \"We are now seeing nearly as many cases of iatrogenic fistula as obstetric fistula. \"That's just shameful. It shows that there are plenty of doctors out there doing more harm than good and they aren't being held accountable.\" ","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":6243}

{"text":"Western medicine was also practiced in China by the Nestorian Christians of the Yuan court, where it was sometimes labeled as huihui or Muslim medicine. The Nestorian physician Jesus the Interpreter founded the Office of Western Medicine in 1263 during the reign of Kublai. According to this office, Chinese medicine consisted of \"natural\" medicines, as opposed to those derived from foreign sources; Western medicines were the opposite. After the Qing dynasty began its rule in the 1870s, Western medicine was no longer practiced in China, and the term huihui was removed from the title of the office.\n\nThe earliest texts written in Western medicine date from the 15th century. According to P. P. von Hildebrand, medical historians have noted several instances of Eastern medicine used to treat Western illness and disease, including the use of Chinese herbal medicine (which has sometimes suffered from corruption as well), Chinese acupuncture, and Western acupuncture. Although Western medicine is sometimes called Chinese medicine today, the terms should ideally be separated, and the West is distinguished from \"China\" by a variety of considerations. For one thing, Western medicine was introduced into China only at the beginning of the 20th century; it was practiced only in imperial clinics, and there was a distinct difference in medical teaching, treatment, and the use of Western medicines. The early 20th century was also the era of the \"New Silk Road,\" an era of globalization in the arts, sciences and technology, which brought new medicine and health technology to the world, and its influence was profound. For another, Western medicine is a diverse and heterogeneous science, with at least 35,000 different drugs, herbs, enzymes, and other medicines. This diversity is especially true of the Chinese varieties of Western medicine, which were created in much smaller batches by many different doctors.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, and with the gradual introduction of modern medicine, Western medicine gained in popularity.

{"text":"Not any longer. Silicon Glen - the name given to the mainly central belt electronics manufacturing phenomenon - continues to decline. The announcement from Texas Instruments that it is pulling out from Greenock, continues the trend. The tech giant, with 30,000 employees around the world, is to move Greenock's chip fabrication to German, Japanese and American plants - not, you'll note, low wage economies. There go 365 jobs, though not before the end of next year. We've seen plenty such announcements before, few of them easing the pain with such a delay. National Semi-conductor was taken over by the Texans five years ago, having been one of the more significant features of Silicon Glen's topography, since first opening up in Inverclyde in 1970. This was not glamorous work. That Greenock plant was criticised for its working conditions. But the Silicon Glen phenomenon was important to replacing the jobs from old industries, which were dying as electronics arrived. The new manufacturers, often headquartered in the US, Japan and South Korea, helped Scotland's new towns establish themselves as economic hubs. They brought new, more efficient work practices, which benefited the wider economy. And they were a means for bringing many more women into the workforce. The priority then was for the Scottish Development Agency (predecessor of Scottish Enterprise) was to attract inward investment with large job numbers. The quality of the jobs didn't matter so much. Some firms brought higher-skilled jobs, with support services, research and development, so that when the manufacturing left, there was a valuable legacy - at IBM in Greenock, for instance, and NCR in Dundee. But most of these jobs had shallow roots in Scotland. They were rapidly culled after the dotcom bust at the turn of the century, while the opening up of quality manufacturing in Central Europe and China enticed the multi-nationals to move production to cheaper, low-wage locations. Within minutes of Texas Instruments confirming its plans to shut up shop in Greenock, the Scottish government was publishing the latest export statistics, covering 2014. It illustrated what has happened to the sector. In 2002, the value of computer equipment exports was \u00a35.6bn, when electronics accounted for 28% of Scotland's exports. By 2014, that was down to \u00a31.1bn, and 4% of exports. Other Scottish government statistics show the fall in value of manufactured electronic equipment, at 2013 prices, from more than \u00a316bn in 2000 to less than \u00a32bn only 13 years later. For all the volatility of the oil industry, there is no sector that witnessed such a sharp decline as electronics. In 1999, it represented 32% of Scottish manufacturing value. Fourteen years later, that was 8%. The share of employment was less significant, both in reaching 16% of manufacturing jobs in 1999, and in the less steep decline to 9% by three years ago. That's a reminder that its importance can be overstated. It was clear, even before the bust, that Scotland's economic developers had to shift from attracting screwdriver\/assembly jobs, and \"move up the value chain\". Grand plans were set out for Project Alba, with thousands of graduate level jobs in Livingston, anchored in an investment by a Californian firm called Cadence. It didn't come to much. But it was a pointer to the way in which the electronics industry would go in Scotland. Instead of making stuff, the move has been to deeper skills in designing and deploying electronics. Silicon Glen's workforce may have plummeted from its peak at nearly 50,000 jobs, but electronics and information technology have infiltrated so many other sectors that it is reckoned more than 80,000 people can now be considered digital. They work across oil and gas, financial services and innovative healthcare. For recruiters, IT skills are consistently the ones in most demand. Those who have them can pick also from the consumer and internet companies which want to be in Scotland for its skills. These include global brands such as Amazon, which has just announced an expansion of its IT development team in Edinburgh. Rockstar North, the company behind Grand Theft Auto computer game, now occupies the prestigious office built for the now-much-diminished Scotsman newspaper. Skyscanner, the travel search engine, also wants these skills, building Scotland's biggest online consumer brand from close to Edinburgh University's dynamic presence. There are reckoned to be more than 1,000 tech companies in Scotland now, many smallish and digital a common factor. This week, work began to clear the site of the Tullis Russell paper mill in Glenrothes - not long closed with the loss of nearly 500 employee-owner jobs. The plan is to replace it by a data centre, powered by renewable biomass energy - symbolic of the shift from paper to gigabytes. Exports from such companies are not easy to count by standing with a clipboard on the quayside at Grangemouth. They are digital, and flow instantly down cables. Because the digital economy is ubiquitous, there is little need to have a name for this. Silicon Glen has all but had its day as the badge for an important part of the transition from the old and manufacturing economy to a computerised and service-based one. The departure of what's left is of course painful for those affected. But the loss is rarely mourned, as the Scottish economy adjusts to a present and future which is digital, brain-powered and forever in flux. ","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":5469}

In modern terms, objective Islam can be referred to as political Islam, which is a dogmatic belief in eternal strife \u2014 jihad \u2014 for the universal unification of Islam and the state. Subjective Islam is represented by the Sufis and all other Muslims who believe in religion as a personal stance or a set of convictions; it separates faith from the state or officialdom. My concept of hudna and tahdi'a is based on the above distinction and interpretation of the two Islams. The paragraphs below will deal with how these two terms are understood in objective (official) Islam.Hudna and Tahdi'a in the Qur'anAfter reviewing what is currently considered the most widely recognized Arabic dictionary of Qur'anic terms, I found that the terms hudna nor tahdi'a have never appeared in any part of the body of Qur'anic verses.2EtymologyBoth words are derived from the original verb form hada'a, which means to be quiet, or to become quiet. Tahdi'a, from hada'a (calmness), according to Ibn Manthur's Arabic dictionary, Lissan al-Arab, is the time of calmness, such as at night when people go to sleep and stop moving or engaging in any activity.Hudna, derived from hadana, is an agreement to stop a fight or a war for a limited period of time.3 Hudna is not permanent and does not imply a potential for stable peace in the far or near future. It is equivalent to the status quo, with no solution to the conflict envisaged. Hence, it is a period for reinforcing the power of each side in a conflict.The Political Theology of IslamTahdi'a is a temporary period of peace after a period or periods of war. We must always bear in mind that the notion of war in Islam is jihad. Therefore, tahdi'a is not a permanent treaty of peace, and neither is hudna. A clear exposition of this issue, the way Muslims deal with it, and the conditions under which they should accept peace with non-Muslims can be found in Mohammad Izzat Darwazah's book, Jihad for the Sake of Allah in the Qur'an and the Hadith. It is a landmark statement of the theory of non-secular Arabism from a Palestinian-Arab-nationalist viewpoint. Most notable is","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":3247}

We hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression, yet the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the Jewish Israeli population. We see no evidence that parallels the position of the Palestinian teenager. We only hear from other Palestinians in prison. I understand restrictions are in place, but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peace.<br \/><br \/>I came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence, so to speak. She continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bomber's parents, and her angry and closed-minded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control. It is more realistic, in my mind, to see the Israeli mindset to be a root of the problem; ignored pleas for understanding and freedom, ignored requests for acknowledgment for the process by which the Jewish population acquired the land.<br \/><br \/>I have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother, which normally would be admirable in a documentary, however in the light of the lack of impartiality, it all seems exploitative.

Me and my friend who love action movies, Independence day, Jurassic Park, LotR, etc. watched this movie and at first, we thought its cool but then we understood the stupid shit they were doing. The main character is a crazy crazy person who doesn't care about anything but having a cool gun and blowing up stuff. It was so dull and boring. There was nothing good about it and the characters looked like they were just thrown together.The best thing I can say is their bad writing. The script was all over the place and there were scenes that just made no sense. They just changed the characters for no reason. In one scene, the hero who is the main character wants everybody to go to his funeral which they all just refuse to. The other group just wants to keep fighting and so do the guys not talking to the new group, even though they're all a bunch of idiots and don't even fight each other. Also the guy that does the fighting is so annoying, I wanted to stab his ass with a sword, like he doesn't care about any of his opponents. If you look at the scene in the end when the heroine saves the main character he's all pissed and doesn't even remember her, I don't know why.

There are a lot of moments where the acting is over-the-top and the dialogue feels cheesy, which is a common problem in soap operas. However, the fact that the show seems to prioritize pleasing women over creating quality storytelling is what really turns me off. It's clear that the writers are more interested in crafting romantic storylines than developing complex characters or engaging plotlines. This can make it hard for anyone who isn't the target audience to get invested in the show and feel like there's anything worthwhile there. \n\nAt the same time, it's important to remember that not everything needs to cater to everyone. Just because I don't enjoy the way this soap opera is written doesn't mean that it's objectively bad or that women shouldn't be allowed to have media that's made for them. However, I do think it's worth examining why so much media aimed at women falls into similar tropes and cliches, and whether or not there are ways to break out of those molds.

{"text":"Not that the outspoken chief executive was all that abashed by his faux pas. And two years earlier, Kenneth Cole, boss of the eponymous clothing and accessories brand, tweeted this howler during the Egyptian revolution: \"Millions are in uproar in #Cairo. Rumor is they heard our new spring collection is now online...\" The twitterstorm that followed forced him to make a swift apology in which he admitted that his tweet had been \"insensitive\" and \"absolutely inappropriate\". So perhaps it is no wonder only 10% of the chief executives running the world's 50 largest companies regularly tweet, according to a survey by marketing consultancy Weber Shandwick. The risk of contracting foot-in-mouth disease seems just too high for many. But Robert Glaesener, boss of Twitter analytics firm Talkwalker, believes the fact that most of them are aged 50-to-60 has more to do with it - they're simply too old to understand social media fully, he says. Even tweeting extrovert Sir Richard Branson, who has more than six million followers and epitomises the consumer-friendly, approachable boss, is prone to the occasional gaffe. His tweet on the day of the fatal Virgin Galactic crash last year began: \"Space is hard - but worth it.\" This was considered insensitive by some commentators and led others to question the legitimacy of his space tourism mission. \"There is a real danger that something that is well meant can end up creating cynicism on social media,\" warns Mr Glaesener. \"While most of the responses to that tweet were positive and supportive, there were also negative responses with people questioning his motives.\" But leaving Twitter campaigns to your corporate PR team sometimes isn't any better. When British Gas decided to hold a Twitter Q&A with customers on the same day it announced price rises of 9.2%, it led to a barrage of abuse hurled at the then customer services director, Bert Pijls. Sources: Talkwalker, Hootsuite, Duke University, Weber Shandwick, Softchoice But are Twitter-shy bosses missing a trick? Done well, a strong Twitter presence can enhance your brand, even if you're not tweeting about your own company, researchers believe. For example, when the state of Indiana passed a law that threatened to allow discrimination against gay people on religious grounds, one of the most influential voices to oppose it was Apple boss, Tim Cook. Using Twitter and the news media, he and other high profile figures put pressure on the state's governor who, within days, revised the legislation and issued reassurances. Mr Cook's \"CEO activism\" benefited his company, too, say researchers from Harvard Business School and Duke University who have been tracking his Twitter use. \"He effectively framed the debate using social media at a time when opinions were being formed and the impact went beyond the political,\" says Aaron Chatterji, a professor at Duke. \"We have found his statements about the law had a positive impact on consumer sentiment for Apple.\" It also helps if you have more than 1.3 million Twitter followers. While only 10% of chief executives regularly used Twitter last year, 28% were members of a social network - up from 16% in 2010 - and many more used platforms like YouTube (38%) and their own company websites (68%). LinkedIn was the most popular platform for CEOs, the research suggests. \"People are interested in the leadership of organisations, so they want to know who's running them, what their beliefs are and what they are all about,\" says Weber Shandwick's Adam Clyne. \"It is also a way for CEOs to have a direct interaction with the public when once upon a time they were only really able to communicate through the media.\" Social media fans say companies can come across as more human on these platforms, as Mr Cook's tweets on politics, green energy, and even American football, demonstrate. Another plus, says Ryan Holmes, chief executive of Hootsuite, a social media tech company, is that leaders can get \"unfiltered\" feedback from their customers. \"Twitter, Facebook and other networks now amount to a huge - and largely free - focus group, at least for CEOs and managers savvy enough to use them,\" he wrote in a LinkedIn blog last month. \"All too often we fall into the emperor-has-no-clothes trap, surrounding ourselves with yes-people who say only what we want to hear.\" This new openness can also help keep companies honest, says Mr Clyne. \"People now expect transparency from organisations and social media allows the public to hold them to account,\" he says. \"It has enabled a real two-way dialogue and organisations have to behave much better because of it.\" While companies are certainly spending more on social media, there is still no definitive way of proving it makes sense financially. But perhaps the most persuasive business case for being on Twitter - and other social media platforms - is that that's where the customers are these days.

UK Parliament boundaries are to be changed under plans to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600. No changes are to be made to the boundary of the Western Isles constituency, Na h-Eileanan an Iar. The three new Highlands constituencies are to be known as Argyll, Bute and Lochaber; Inverness and Skye; and Highland North. The seat of Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey is to be largely absorbed into the new Inverness and Skye. Part of Lochaber would form Argyll, Bute and Lochaber. Highland North would be the UK's largest-ever constituency, covering Caithness, Sutherland, Wester Ross and Easter Ross. Highland councillor Audrey Sinclair said it would be difficult for an MP to service such a big area. She said: \"I feel sorry for the constituents because just how often would they see an MP? \"Also, the person who is actually elected would have a very difficult job to make sure that they do cover all the area.\" Lyn Kilpatrick, of Kilmallie in Lochaber, said communities and community assets would be lost from the traditional area of Lochaber. The boundary changes would, for example, see the base of Lochaber Rugby Club inside the new constituency of Inverness and Skye, she said. She added: \"It may seem a marginal issue, but I think it is important. The commission says itself that it tries to retain people's traditional communities and people's sense of who they are and what they belong to for UK parliamentary purposes.\" Full reviews of UK Parliament constituencies are carried out every five years and Scottish Parliament boundaries about every 10 years, with interim reviews of selected areas sooner if considered necessary. Isobel Drummond Murray, of the Boundary Commission, said: \"Part of the change is to balance a legislative requirement with coming up with sensible proposals. \"There may be tensions in some areas and Scotland certainly has challenging geography in places and the commission is aware of these challenges.\" ","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":2306}

{"text":"Fly-half Steve Crosbie, making his first start, kicked three first-half penalties and converted Eoin McKeon's try to put the visitors 16-0 ahead. Two more from Crosbie made it 22-0 but a penalty try and a score from Hamish Watson gave Edinburgh belated hope. Glenn Bryce added a third with six minutes left but the visitors held on. The champions remain seventh in the Pro12, well outside the play-off places, while defeat was a seventh at home in the league for Edinburgh, and a fourth in a row since moving to Myreside in the new year. Those last four losses have been by a combined total of nine points, and after exiting the European Challenge Cup in the quarter-finals last week, the end of the season cannot come quickly enough for the capital side. They enjoyed the majority of possession and territory in the opening quarter, but errors undermined them at critical moments. One multi-phase attack ended with prop Simon Berghan penalised for holding on in the tackle; another broke down when Duncan Weir knocked on a Nathan Fowles pass. The Scotland fly-half had already missed a penalty attempt, but Connacht counterpart Crosbie made no mistake with two chances to put the visitors 6-0 up. Last year's champions started to show glimpses of their potent attack, Tiernan O'Halloran releasing the dangerous Niyi Adeolokun with a superb flicked pass, and they scored on their first visit to Edinburgh's 22. The hosts' defence was breached far too easily as flanker McKeon powered on to Kieran Marmion's short pass, Crosbie converting for a 13-0 lead. Weir pulled a second simple penalty attempt wide to further dampen Edinburgh spirits, Crosbie maintaining his 100% record with a third penalty to put the visitors in command by the interval. The pattern continued on the resumption, Edinburgh fashioning an opening down the right when Damien Hoyland released Rory Scholes, only to concede another breakdown penalty. Crosbie made it 19-0 with another kick and Connacht should have had a second try but for a dropped pass in the right corner. Weir was fortunate to escape a yellow card for a high tackle around the neck of replacement prop Finlay Bealham, but Crosbie dispensed punishment with another three points before being replaced by Jack Carty. Edinburgh belatedly roused themselves, scoring two tries in the space of four minutes to give themselves hope, despite initially botching a three-on-one overlap after a blind-side break. O'Halloran was adjudged to have deliberately strayed offside in intercepting a scoring pass, referee Daniel Jones awarding a penalty try and dispatching the full-back to the sin-bin. The impressive Watson then spun out of two tackles to burrow over, Weir converting both scores to reduce the gap to eight points. Six minutes from time, full-back Bryce dotted down his first try for the club.  But Weir's conversion attempt drifted wide, and another trademark late rally fell short. Edinburgh head coach Duncan Hodge told BBC Scotland: \"It might sound a bit bizarre, but there were so many positives in there - the way we attacked in the second half, some of the attack in the first half, a lot of great defensive sets. \"But we gave away 11 or 12 penalties.  It was 16-0 at half-time and they were in our half four times. \"It is maddening.  The players are working so hard and that was an unbelievable effort in the second half.

Nearly twice as many people used the money to pay for daily living costs rather than pay off debts. \"The pension freedoms are popular with consumers but some people are experiencing unexpected losses,\" said Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice. \"The changes are giving huge numbers of people the choice of how to access their retirement savings, offering them more options about how to use the money to best fit their lives. \"As people's pension choices become more complicated government and providers need to continue their work to promote free Pension Wise guidance, ensuring people are fully informed about their options as they move from work into retirement.\" Pensions: Could you run out of money before you die?

After breathing the gas himself, he wrote: \"The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air, but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards.\" Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled \"An Account of Further Discoveries in Air\" which was included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air.

{"text":"Creepy IMF Paper Teaches Governments How to Wage War on Cashby SchiffGold 1Share this:TweetEmailThere's been another shot fired in the \"war on cash.\" Recently, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) published a working paper offering governments suggestions on how to move toward a cashless society even in the face of strong public opposition.Over the last several years, we've seen a steady push to eliminate, or at least limit, the use of cash around the world. In May of 2016, the European Central bank announced it will stop producing and issuing 500-euro notes by the end of 2018. Not long before the EU announcement, a former Obama economic adviser\/ex-Treasury secretary floated the idea of eliminating the $100 bill in the US.Banks have also gotten in on the act. Last year, Chase capped ATM withdrawals for non-Chase customers at $1,000 per day. Recently, ATMs in Mexico stopped issuing 500-peso notes, leaving the 200-peso note as the highest denomination available. CitiBank Australia stopped handling cash transactions altogether late last year.Indians also felt the squeeze last fall. On Nov. 8, the Indian government declared that 1,000 and 500 rupee notes would no longer be valid. They gave the public just four hours notice. Why? To force so-called \"black money\" into the light.About 90% of all transactions in India are in cash. It is an overwhelmingly cash economy and virtually every Indian has currency stashed away in their home. The government can't tax transactions using black money. By making the 1,000 and 500 rupee notes valueless, government officials hope to force the black money into the economy so they can get their cut.Officials always justify their war on cash with talk about \"customer preference,\" and fighting terrorism and drugs, but the drive toward a cashless society is really about control.By controlling access to your own money, banks and governments increase their control over you. They can collect maximum taxes and fees, they can track purchases, and they can even manipulate your spending habits by imposing negative interest rates that effectively charge you for saving.Needless to say, many everyday people like cash and the relative freedom it provides. In a worst-case scenario, they can at least shield their wealth by shoving cash under their mattresses. You can't do that if there isn't any cash.Well, the IMF wants to help governments crack down on cash in a kinder and gentler way. In \"The Macroeconomics of De-Cashing,\" IMF analyst Alexei Kireyev explains how governments can overcome the objections of their citizens as they wage their war on cash.\"Although some countries most likely will de-cash in a few years, going completely cashless should be phased in steps.

{"text":"Strongbow Exploration Inc said it plans to bring the South Crofty tin mine in Cornwall out of administration in a deal thought to be worth about \u00a31.4m. The firm says South Crofty offers one of the best tin opportunities available globally. Commercial production ended at the mine in 1998 and Strongbow Exploration is the third company attempting to restart the business. Neil Gallacher, BBC South West Business Correspondent It's nearly two decades since South Crofty was last in commercial production and the intervening years have taught everyone to be cautious about the prospects for restarting mining. This third attempt is interestingly timed as commodities prices have been on a steep slide over the last few years. However since January the tin price has rallied. What is certain is that it is a deep and flooded mine and nobody will get serious commercial mining going here without deep pockets to match. South Crofty, at Pool in mid Cornwall, went into administration in June 2013 when Western United Mines (WUM) blamed a failure to receive promised investment cash. The price of tin has risen from about \u00a33,000 a tonne in 1998 to a current price of around \u00a317,000 a tonne. ","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":1184}

Director and co-scriptwriter Dani Levy does not bother about those mechanics, he thinks that certain things simply ARE funny, the fact that two orderlies are gay and kiss over a man in a coma, for example. Do not get me wrong, some people can MAKE that funny, Dani Levy can't, not for me, anyway.<br \/><br \/>The main problem I have with this movie is that I can't see a reason behind the way the main characters behave.

Their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other (well, one is a lesbian now but raises the daughter she has with her cousin).

{"text":"The government had said that companies should meet the requirements of a 2008 indigenisation law by the end of March. Theoretically, non-compliance could lead to a company losing its license. This was a key part of Robert Mugabe's 2013 election campaign - on the basis that black people were discriminated against during the colonial era. But it has proved controversial, with detractors saying that it could discourage much-needed foreign direct investment. The Reuters news agency quotes the minister responsible, Patrick Zhuwao, as saying that most of the country's foreign-owned banks and mining companies have not submitted their indigenisation plans, adding that he thought they would do soon. But Mr Zhuwao told the BBC that his ministry was currently \"going through submissions made by companies [and] we don't have statistics yet\" on who has complied. Standard Chartered and Barclays are among the banks operating in the country, and Zimbabwe also hosts the mining firms Anglo American Platinum and Impala Platinum. BBC Africa Business Report editor Matthew Davies says that an attempt to implement the law two years ago was largely ignored, but this time the government is promising action. The indigenisation plan for businesses echoes the country's land reform programme that started in 2000. At that time, the process of transferring around 4,500 farms held by white commercial farmers distributed to nearly 170,000 black Zimbabwean families began. This has been widely blamed for causing Zimbabwe's economic collapse, but a 2010 study by Sussex University found that the programme had had some positive effects, and that the idea that it was a complete failure was a myth.

Some time later, Dyrrachium\u2014one of the most important naval bases of the Adriatic\u2014fell again to Byzantine hands. The battle of Dyrrachium was a significant event for the Byzantine war effort, insofar as it enabled Constantinople, through the construction of the Dyrrachion castle under the rule of Manuel Comnenos, to monitor and control the sea-passage in the region. Also, as a result of this victorious and long-fought struggle, Byzantium acquired a large-scale fleet consisting of forty-one ships. The city of Dyrrachium was eventually seized by the Venetians (1308). However, this was not accomplished without a large-scale, protracted struggle between the Byzantines and the Venetians, in which the latter repeatedly fell to attack, only to recover and reseize Dyrrachium shortly after. The Venetians, on the contrary, made several and frequent attacks on the city (which was the last Byzantine stronghold in the region, after the conquest of Otranto (which had fallen in 1048) and of numerous other territories).

{"text":"This week she has attended a string of fundraisers, filling her war chest to bombard key states with commercials as the election nears. She has already reserved slots worth $80m (\u00a360.7m). And yet two-thirds of the American people say they do not find her honest or trustworthy.  And that is her flaw. This week she has been on the defensive. The nagging question is whether, when she was Secretary of State, she traded access to herself and others in government in exchange for payments to the charity the Clinton Foundation. Her campaign denies the claim and says there is no proof. An investigation by Associated Press, fiercely contested by the Clinton campaign, found that a significant number of people she met outside government ended up paying into the Clinton Foundation. For the time being this is less about facts and more about the perception that access to Mrs Clinton was related in some way to donations. The question is why she didn't take steps to place herself above suspicion. It enables Donald Trump to call the Clinton Foundation a \"crooked enterprise\" and to argue that \"it's impossible to figure out where the State Department begins and the Clinton Foundation ends\". And then there was the use of a private server and her emails. After months of stories she has still been unable to put the issue of these emails to rest. The FBI has turned over to the State Department another 15,000 emails that were discovered on her private server. Some of them undoubtedly will be published before the election. Again no \"smoking gun\" has been found although the FBI judged her handling of classified information as \"extremely careless\". But why didn't she opt for complete disclosure and transparency much earlier? And then there is a liking for secrecy. She hasn't given a full news conference in more than nine months. She has held more than 300 fund-raising events, but only five have been open to reporters. She is not a natural campaigner and can sometimes lack warmth and spontaneity. Recently the singer Cher, at a fund-raising event, described her as \"shy and not the greatest speaker in the world\". It is as if, after years of accusations and investigations, she has drawn up her defences. When her husband was in the White House she spoke of a \"vast right-wing conspiracy\" aimed against them. And she has reason to be defensive. During this campaign there are swirling conspiracies, stoked on the Internet, that, for instance, she's hiding health problems. On one late night show she was asked \"can you open this jar of pickles?\" to somehow demonstrate her robust health. She is on course to become the next President but she lacks popularity. The first woman President would be another moment of history but, so far, there is little excitement at the prospect. Perhaps after Margaret Thatcher and Angela Merkel, a woman leader attracts less attention. She has detailed proposals on creating jobs and spending on infrastructure and her main theme - rebuilding America's middle class - is a strong pitch. The fact is that Mr Trump makes Clinton's success likely and Clinton's flaws give Trump reason to believe. He currently sees her character as his strongest card while the Democrats depict Trump as unqualified and unfit to lead and govern. So Clinton will assert that the Trump campaign is a brand of political conservatism associated with white nationalism and nativism. She accuses Trump of '\"taking a hate movement mainstream\". As Labor Day approaches the election has all the appearance of a bare-knuckle fight focused on character between two flawed candidates. Many American people will be drawn to Trump's promise to tear down the establishment but many others will incline to Clinton and her claim to represent the mainstream in American life.

{"text":"The Belfast Telegraph says that about 85 killers a year get days out from Northern Ireland jails. The paper obtained the figures from the Department of Justice after murderer Stephen Scott was seen at his mother's home in Warrenpoint at the weekend. It says that less than one in 10 requests for leave are turned down. In response to these revelations, many are calling for stricter laws and tighter regulations regarding prisoner release in Northern Ireland. Some argue that it is simply too easy for convicted killers to be granted temporary leave from prison, putting the public at risk. On the other hand, others point out that prisoners do have the right to spend time with their families and reintegrate into society, which can ultimately lead to a lower rate of recidivism. It's a complex issue with no easy answers, but one thing is for sure: this latest news has reignited the debate over prisoner release policies in Northern Ireland.","prompt_len":318.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":944}
{"text":"the idea of  receptor mosaics  is that proteins may form complex and dynamic networks with respect to time and composition . these have the potential to markedly expand the diversity and specificity of g protein - coupled receptors ( gpcr ) signaling , particularly in neural cells , where a few key receptors have been implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders , including addiction . metabotropic glutamate type 5 receptors ( mglu5 ) can form complexes with other gpcrs , including adenosine a2a and dopamine d2 receptors . The formation of such complexes can modulate the downstream signaling pathways, thereby influencing various physiological and pathological processes. For instance, the mGlu5-A2A receptor complex has been found to regulate striatal dopamine release, which is implicated in reward processing and addiction. Furthermore, dysregulation of mGlu5 signaling has been linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Thus, understanding the intricate mechanisms by which receptor mosaics operate is crucial for developing effective therapies for neurological and psychiatric disorders. Recent advances in high-resolution imaging and proteomics offer exciting opportunities to unravel the complexities of receptor mosaics and their role in cellular signaling.","prompt_len":541.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1335}

Although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there, the pace of The Gathering is slow, the makeup somewhat inadequate, and the plot confusing. Worse, the characterization in the premiere episode is poor. It is not the writing alone that is weak. The setting is an odd one, and the characters are uncharismatic in their reactions to it. Still, these flaws are minor, which is why I have not completely given up on it.\n\nI enjoy the setting of The Gathering immensely. It is a dark and somewhat futuristic setting, in which the \"good guys\" are almost universally evil, but they use the excuse \"God does it\" to avoid looking at their own wrong behavior.

{"text":"Emma is a horribly flawed film based on Jane Austens classic novel. I have not read the book so I really didn't know that much about the plot, and yet I still predicted nearly the entire plot. There were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing. For example, the scene where Emma and Mr. Knightley argue on the hill felt forced and lacked any real emotion. It was as if the director just told the actors to shout at each other without giving them any real motivation. Additionally, the pacing of the film was off, with some scenes dragging on for too long while others felt rushed and lacked any meaningful dialogue.\n\nOne of the biggest problems with the film was the characterization of Emma. In the novel, Emma is a flawed but ultimately well-meaning character. However, in the film, she comes across as selfish and manipulative, making it difficult to root for her. This also makes it hard to believe her eventual redemption at the end of the film.\n\nOverall, Emma fails to capture the essence of Jane Austen's novel, with poor writing, directing, and characterization.

The rest of the Earth's crust is also made of oxygen compounds, in particular various complex silicates (in silicate minerals). This abundance of oxygen in the Earth's crust is due to intense geological processes that caused the formation of these compounds over millions of years. The formation of rocks involving compounds containing oxygen is called silicate mineralization. Silicate mineralization is a long-lasting process, as the compounds involved in the formation of rocks and minerals require high temperatures and pressures to create stable and durable structures.\n\nIn addition to the Earth's crust, oxygen is also found in various water resources around the planet. Oxygen is a crucial element for life, as many organisms require it for survival. In fact, the process of photosynthesis in plants and algae involves the use of carbon dioxide and the production of oxygen as a byproduct.\n\nIn conclusion, while oxygen may be present only in trace quantities in the Earth's atmosphere, it plays a vital role in the planet's geology, water resources, and ultimately in sustaining life. The abundance of oxygen compounds in the Earth's crust also highlights the significant role geological processes have played in shaping our world as we know it today.","prompt_len":495.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1626}

{"text":"The work and pensions secretary - a friend and ally of the PM - has been made First Secretary of State, effectively her second in command. Michael Gove, one of the driving forces of the Brexit campaign, returns to the front bench as environment secretary. The previous incumbent, Andrea Leadsom, has been appointed as the leader of the House in the Commons. Most other ministers have kept their roles -  but Liz Truss is moved from justice to chief treasury secretary. Commons leader David Liddington takes over as justice secretary and Lord Chancellor. Chief Treasury Secretary David Gauke has been appointed work and pensions secretary. Live: Reaction to Mrs May's cabinet reshuffle Mrs May had been expected to carry out a widespread reshuffle of her top team after Thursday's general election but her room for manoeuvre has been limited by her failure to win an overall majority. Most of the cabinet jobs remain unchanged: Damian Green, who was previously work and pensions secretary and was at university with Mrs May, has also become minister for the Cabinet Office, a position left vacant by Ben Gummer, who lost his seat in Thursday's general election. The First Secretary of State is a role previously held by George Osborne and, under Labour, Peter Mandelson and could see Mr Green standing in for Theresa May at prime minister's questions when she is not available. The role is periodically used by UK governments and did not exist in Mrs May's first cabinet, formed after she became prime minister in July last year. It does not come with a government department but does give its holder seniority over other cabinet ministers and is seen as being similar to the role of deputy prime minister. Boris Johnson said that while the public would be wondering about the future of the current government, Mrs May had got the biggest Conservative mandate anyone had achieved for decades. \"It's absolutely right that she should go ahead, form a government and deliver on the priorities of the people. \"I'm going to be backing her, and absolutely everybody I'm talking to is going to be backing her as well.\" In the latest fallout from the general election result, which confounded pollsters and left the UK with a hung Parliament: Liam Fox retains his position as international trade secretary - he told reporters he was \"delighted\" to be continuing in the role he has held since July last year. Dr Fox told the BBC that Mrs May was in a \"very positive\" mood during her reshuffle conversations. \"It's now time for the whole of the Conservative party to rally behind the prime minister and get a government in the national interest. \"I have absolute faith in the prime minister. She is the best person to take this country forward in terms of being able to give a government that is genuinely in our national interest, and I very much look forward to working with her.\" Dr Fox was one of the Cabinet's \"three Brexiteers\" with David Davis and Boris Johnson, who have also kept their roles, as the government gears up for the start of talks with Brussels. Liz Truss's change of position will be seen by some as a demotion - she was widely criticised by the judiciary following the High Court ruling regarding the government seeking Parliament's permission to trigger Article 50 and begin the formal start of the Brexit process. The judges involved were heavily criticised by some newspapers, and Mrs Truss was in turn criticised for failing to stand up for them. Justine Greening remains as education secretary - her opposition to Theresa May's policy of expanding grammar schools might be less of an issue now, if, as some expect, the government is forced to drop it from the Queen's Speech to prevent a backbench revolt.

This indicates that the physical conditions surrounding the black hole and the dust responsible for the red colors may be similar across a wide range of AGN.\n\nFurthermore, the sample of AGN analyzed is described as \"flat-spectrum radio-loud,\" which means they emit significant amounts of radiation across a broad range of frequencies, including in the radio band.

The hearing at Fort Sam Houston, at which Sgt Bergdahl did not testify, was held to determine whether there is enough evidence to have a military trial. Sgt Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban just 24 hours after he left his post in 2009 and he was finally released last year in exchange for five Taliban commanders held at US detention centre Guantanamo Bay. The move sparked controversy in the US with Republicans saying the deal could have put American lives at risk. Gen Dahl said he did not think Sgt Bergdahl should go to prison. If convicted, he faces life in prison or a dishonourable discharge from the military. Commanding officers from his unit testified on Friday that searching for Sgt Bergdahl put other soldiers in danger. He originally wanted to end up at a forward operating base about 19 miles (30km) away and create a \"PR event\" that would enable him to get the attention of a general, the court heard. \"He felt it was his duty to intervene,\" said Gen Dahl of Sgt Bergdahl's reasons for leaving the unit, and said his perceptions about issues were \"completely off the mark.\" The soldier felt the problems were so severe that they put his platoon in danger, but that was not true, said the officer. Sgt Bergdahl had claimed another soldier in his unit kicked rocks over Afghan graves, but that was not substantiated.

All patients were between the ages of 18 and 65 and received heart transplants at a single center. The blood samples were collected and analyzed for sST2 levels and compared to biopsy results for acute rejection. The primary objective was to determine if sST2 levels could predict acute rejection episodes in heart transplant patients, with a secondary objective of evaluating the correlation between sST2 and other commonly used biomarkers.\n\nThe study found a significant correlation between sST2 levels and acute rejection, with higher levels of sST2 indicating a greater likelihood of rejection. Additionally, sST2 showed a stronger correlation with rejection than other commonly used biomarkers like troponin and brain natriuretic peptide.\n\nThe findings suggest that sST2 may be a valuable surrogate marker for acute rejection after heart transplant, potentially reducing the need for invasive biopsies. Further research is needed to confirm these results and determine the clinical utility of sST2 as a diagnostic tool for rejection surveillance in heart transplant patients.","prompt_len":632.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1713}

What I used to prefer about 'Menagerie' was that it's more hard-core Star Trek with this fascinating back-story to the then-current Trek storyline. I still think it's fairly ingenious the way Gene Roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a two-part episode. However, 'City on the Edge of Forever' is now my top pick because of its powerful storyline and exploration of complex moral dilemmas. It's interesting to see how the crew grapples with the idea of sacrificing one life for the greater good, and it really challenges the audience to think about their own values and priorities. Plus, the chemistry between Kirk and Edith Keeler is just electric, and the ending is incredibly poignant.

{"text":"Adenoid Hynkel, a lowly soldier in World War One, rises in subsequent years to become the ruthless dictator of Toumania. He creates an aggressive, antisemitic war machine and cultivates a little toothbrush moustache. Sound like anyone you know?<br \/><br \/>From the safety of Hollywood, Chaplin uses this soapbox to exhort Europe to take up arms and defy Hitler and Mussolini. Given that the United States in 1940 had more than a year of neutrality ahead of it, and no strong desire to embroil itself in Europe's civil strife (remember, it was Hitler who declared war on the USA, not the other way round) it is surprising that Chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate polemic.<br \/><br \/>The story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and repellant Hynkel and the reign of terror over which he ineptly presides, and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly, humane, brave, etc., etc, Chaplin is Hynkel, and he also plays The Jewish Barber, the little hero of the ghetto (The Tramp in all but name). Needless to say, Chaplin writes, directs, stars, composes the music and does the catering.<br \/><br \/>In 1940 the full truth was not yet known about the Third Reich, and Chaplin can be forgiven for having something less than perfect historical foresight, but even by the standards of the day he gets Hitler badly wrong. A comedian and a sentimentalist, Chaplin tries to ridicule Hitler by making Hynkel silly and hapless. All this does is to humanise him. When Hynkel the not-very-warlike soldier fools around with the big gun and the upside-down aeroplane, he becomes endearing rather than despicable. As dictator, he inspects his subordinates' technical innovations which don't work (the parachute hat, the bulletproof uniform etc.) and these passages are meant to make us think that the real-life Nazis are incompetent and can be swept aside. In fact, Hynkel's regime is made cute and likeable by its bumbling bodgery.<br \/><br \/>In truth, Chaplin's day had already passed when he made this ill-considered polemic. At heart, he was still a dinosaur of the silent screen (check out the humour, with gags like staggering up and down the street semi-conscious, or the pantomime of the coins in the puddings). The hero Schultz is meant to represent a yardstick of European decency against which Hynkel can be judged, but Schultz looks more like a character from operetta than a Nazi. Is it in any way believable that a Schultz figure (if such had existed) would say to the Fuehrer's face, \"\"your cause is doomed to failure because it's built upon the stupid, ruthless persecution of innocent people\"\"? And how does Schultz come to be in the cellars of the jewish ghetto? If he is the object of an exhaustive manhunt, why does he persist in wearing his Ruritanian uniform? Chaplin did not yet know the full horrors of Auschwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka, but the Nazi concentration camp which he offers us is hopelessly out of kilter with the grim spirit of the age. As usual, Chaplin thinks in terms of 'silent' comedy set-pieces, loosely pegged onto the narrative clothes line. There is the knockabout scrapping with the stormtroopers, shaving a man to the accompaniment of Brahms, and the globe ballet (watch for the segment filmed in reverse).<br \/><br \/>Paulette Goddard is the unremittingly perfect Hannah. Just as the people of the ghetto are impossibly nice, and the jewish haven in Osterlich is ridiculously idyllic, so Hannah is quite literally too good to be true. Brave, defiant, resourceful, hardworking and (of course) beautiful, she is the canary of judaism in the ghetto cage. \"\"Gee, ain't I cute?\"\" she asks, after the Barber gives her a make-over. Too cute by far, is the answer. She doesn't come close to ringing true, because Chaplin has made her a caricature. The 'wouldn't it be wonderful?' speech which Chaplin puts into her mouth is typical of the author - too wordy, too emotionally cloying.<br \/><br \/>Jack Oakie is great as Napaloni, the fascist dictator of Bacteria. He brings a whiff of much-needed comic brio to the proceedings, but the film's underlying weakness remains. If Napaloni is silly and ineffective, how can we fear him? And anyway, the stuttering stop-start of the back-projected train is a fine Chaplinesque example of a gag that is persisted with far beyond its comic worth.<br \/><br \/>And where did the Jewish Barber acquire that immaculate Hynkel uniform?\"","prompt_len":null,"label":"human","text_length":4429}

A decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either yes or no, or alternately either 1 or 0. A decision problem can be viewed as a formal language, where the members of the language are instances whose output is yes, and the non-members are those instances whose output is no. The question of interest is: on what inputs will the problem accept yes? The difficulty of this question is measured with a complexity measure often called the decision complexity. Decision complexity is central in the complexity theory of many-one reductions, the computational theory of random generators, the problem of non-determinism (the Turing problem), and as of late, the study of circuit complexity. The Turing problem is, on our view, the most fundamental problem in computational complexity theory. The Turing problem is (roughly) to answer whether given a circuit, the output will be yes. One of the key results of decision complexity theory is circuit-decision completeness. Specifically, there exist polynomial time reductions from the decision version of circuit complexity to both the decision version of the Turing problem and to the decision version of random generation.

{"text":"While everyone agreed on the need for new homes, \"too many\" opposed them in their own community, Mr Javid told the Conservative Party conference. While there were valid reasons for stopping developments, on grounds of size and taste, he said the UK couldn't afford to build so few homes. He announced the \"largest state-backed\" housing programme since the 1970s. Addressing activists in Birmingham, Mr Javid said there had been \"massive progress\" since 2010 but there was still a \"long, long way to go\" and the simple fact was that too many people were priced out of housing market and had little chance of owning their home. The 170,000 homes built in England last year, he said, was simply not enough to keep up with demand. Pledging to tackle the obstacles to new schemes, he called on developers to \"release their stranglehold\" over land and stop building up so-called land banks. And targeting 'nimbyism' (which stands for 'not in my backyard') he said local communities had to reflect on the UK's national priorities not just their own. \"Everyone agrees we need more homes, but too many object to them being next to us,\" he said. \"We have got to change that attitude. Of course there are sometimes some valid reasons for opposing some local planning applications - if they are in the wrong place, if there is not enough infrastructure or if they are just plain ugly, but all of us we have a duty to think of the long-term consequences of every decision we make. \"We have a responsibility to build more houses, a responsibility not just to our constituents but to the next generation.\" Unveiling what he described as \"unprecedented\" plans to \"open up the market\", he said the government would borrow \u00c2\u00a32bn to support the \"Accelerated Construction\" scheme, which aims to get houses built on publicly-owned \"brownfield\" land available for swift development. Mr Javid said the cash would encourage new developers to build up to 15,000 homes by 2021. There would also be a \u00c2\u00a33bn Home Building Fund to provide loans to stimulate projects, which he said would build more than 25,000 homes by 2020, with a long-term goal to build more than 200,000. \"This is just the beginning,\" he added. \"We will publish a housing white paper later this year with further significant measures all helping us towards our ambitions of a million new homes by 2020.\" The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, said more attention must be given to tackling the \"growing backlog\" in developments which had received planning permission but which had yet to get under way. \"Councils are approving nine in 10 planning applications yet our recent analysis also shows there are hundreds of thousands of homes with planning permission which are still waiting to be built,\" said its chair Lord Porter. \"Councils need more powers to encourage developers to build homes more quickly.\" The Green Party said the plans failed to tackle the \"underlying causes\" of the housing crisis, such as the sale of council homes and \"tax breaks\" for buy-to-let investors, while the Liberal Democrats dismissed the announcements as a \"drop in the ocean\". \"If the government wants to solve our country's housing crisis they will have to do much, much more than the level of investment announced today,\" said its leader Tim Farron. \"Experts say we need to be building 300,000 homes a year- double what we currently build.

All five of the paths are fully marked and people walk them by themselves regularly. But this is the first time the walks will have been done as a guided trail. The 124km journey, which begins in County Cork, will take place throughout Irish Heritage Week, 19 - 26 August, covering five ancient routes. Those trekking along Ireland's \"Pilgrims Paths\" can get their pilgrim passport stamped every time a path is completed. If all five are stamped, they get a Teastas Oilithreachta (pilgrim certificate) from Ballintubber Abbey in County Mayo. The paths: John O'Dwyer, chairman of Pilgrim Paths Ireland, the group organising the walks, told the BBC that the trails have been around for a long time. \"Many people wouldn't have known about them, but the popularity of the Camino de Santiago has helped raise awareness,\" said Mr O'Dwyer. \"In fact, lots of Irish people were going to Spain to the Camino, unaware there will pilgrim paths on their own doorstep,\" he added. Pilgrim Paths Ireland is a group of volunteers who aim to \"promote awareness and use\" of the historic pilgrim routes. Mr O'Dwyer said anyone can do the paths: \"You can trot along them yourself or be part of a group. \"We don't have a linear path like the Camino but instead have taken five of the foremost paths and put them together. \"Apart from one, each path can be done in a day.

{"text":"the advantage of pauli - villars regularization in quantum field theory quantized on the light front is explained . Pauli-Villars regularization is particularly advantageous in quantum field theory when it is quantized on the light front. One reason for this is that in light front quantization, the physical system is quantized on a null plane rather than in the traditional time-slice formulation. This leads to a simpler formalism for solving scattering amplitudes in many-body systems.\n\nFurthermore, when using Pauli-Villars regularization on the light front, the resulting quantized field theory is free of infrared divergences. Infrared divergences arise when the momentum of a particle approaches zero, and they can lead to unphysical results in calculations. However, Pauli-Villars regularization effectively removes these infrared divergences, making the results of calculations more reliable.\n\nAnother advantage of Pauli-Villars regularization in light front quantization is that it is compatible with the Fock space expansion. The Fock space expansion is a powerful tool used in quantum field theory to describe multi-particle states. By using Pauli-Villars regularization, one can construct a consistent Fock space expansion, which is essential for understanding the behavior of many-body systems.\n\nIn summary, Pauli-Villars regularization is a powerful tool in the quantization of quantum field theory on the light front. Through this technique, one can eliminate infrared divergences and construct a consistent Fock space expansion, leading to more accurate and reliable results in calculations involving many-body systems.","prompt_len":115.0,"label":"gpt3re","text_length":1637}

{"text":"Giuga's conjecture says that this equation is also a sufficient condition for p to be prime. Another consequence of Fermat's little theorem is the following: if p is a prime number other than 2 and 5, 1\/p is always a recurring decimal, whose period is p \u2212 1 or a divisor of p \u2212 1. The fraction 1\/p expressed likewise in base q (rather than base 10) has similar effect, provided that p is not a prime factor of q. Wilson's theorem says that an integer p > 1 is prime if and only if the factorial (p \u2212 1)! = (1\/p) has exactly p \u2212 1 distinct prime factors, including 1.\n\nWilson's theorem can also be applied to irrational numbers. There is a prime between any two consecutive rational multiples (powers) of two non-trivial real numbers x and y; i.e., there is a prime between x\/2 and (x\/2)\u00b2 or y\/2 and (y\/2)\u00b2. Note that there are two such prime numbers between 100 and 101. The proof can be illustrated as follows: first, 100 cannot be written as a sum of two squares of rational numbers smaller than 100, since the smallest two squares whose sum is 100 are 36\u00b2 + 12\u00b2 and 25\u00b2 + 8\u00b2: either of those two squares will in the original sum contain less than 1 and thus cannot be canceled. Therefore, there are, for example, no 35-sided primes. \n\nOne can try a similar proof (replacing rationals by irrationals) for an even larger number of consecutive squares; that is, for xy\/2, where x and y are irrational. However, in this case there are no primes between xy\/2 and (xy + (xy\/2))\u00b2 or between yx\/2 and (yx + (yx\/2))\u00b2. For instance, in the case of 57, the first one is 1057 and the last one is 2","prompt_len":503.0,"label":"llama","text_length":1588}

The data collected by the Planck Collaboration has provided new insights into the dynamics of the intracluster medium and its interactions with dark matter. Additionally, the precise measurements of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect in the Coma cluster can be used to study the expansion rate of the universe, known as the Hubble constant.

{"text":"\"It's not the spirit of the law. Companies should be much more careful about their reputation,\" he told ITV. The \u00a37.20 hourly rate for workers aged 25 and over came into effect in April. Many firms have cut overtime pay rates or benefits such as free lunches to fund the rise in basic pay rates. The National Living Wage and you 'Thousands to be stuck on lowest pay' Mr Osborne's warning comes after a debate in the Commons on Monday on the impact of the 50p hourly increase in the National Living Wage (NLW), said profitable firms trying to \"evade the spirit\" of the new laws would face government pressure. \"I promise you that we will use the full force of our office, little though it sometimes feels, to put pressure on those companies to live up not only to the legal obligations, which are our job in making legislation in this House, but to their moral obligations, which are the ones that we feel matter a great deal more,\" said Conservative minister Nick Boles. A motion warning the wage changes have left thousands of low-paid workers \"significantly worse off\" and calling on the government to ensure they are protected was passed unopposed. DIY chain B&Q, supermarket Tesco, coffee chain Caffe Nero and the John Lewis Partnership have all recently reduced some staff payments or perks, but most have said the moves were unrelated to the 50p-an-hour increase in the National Living Wage (NLW). B&Q initially said it planned to cut Sunday and Bank holiday pay rates in exchange for lifting the lowest hourly rate for all staff to \u00a37.66 from 1 April, 46p-an-hour above the NLW. It later decided to extend compensation for workers who were adversely affected by this change to two years, from one after nearly 140,000 people signed a petition against the cuts. In April, Caffe Nero said it would no longer give its staff a free lunch when they are on shift, as part of a \"pay review\" introduced in response to the new National Living Wage. The John Lewis Partnership - which includes supermarket chain Waitrose - said it stopped so-called premium payments - higher hourly rates for overtime or Sunday working - from 1 February after realising competitors did not offer the same deal. \"Premium payments are not a feature of the market,\" a spokeswoman for the group told the BBC. She said the decision was announced in September last year, before the new National Living Wage was announced, and was unrelated. She also said the group's average hourly pay rate, outside London, was above the NLW at \u00a37.80. Similarly, Tesco said from 3 July all staff who worked on Sundays and Bank holidays would be paid at time-and-a-half, rather than the current double time rate received by staff on older contracts, but said staff negatively affected would receive a lump sum covering 18 months of the pay difference. It also said the average hourly rate for staff was above the NLW at \u00a37.62 an hour. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the government's regulatory watchdog - has warned that 60,000 jobs will be lost by 2020 as a direct result of the National Living Wage (NLW).
